@article{Moriano2014,
abstract = {Social media data have been increasingly used to assess the impact of scholarly research. Such data provide complementary metrics (often called altmetrics) to traditional impact indicators. This paper provides a summary on the diffusion of scholarly content in social media, based on a collection of tweets citing papers from a set of 27 academic publishers within various fields between 2011 and 2013. We first show that there has been an increasing adoption of Twitter as a channel to disseminate scholarly literature. In particular, between 2012 and 2013, the number of scholarly tweets and the fraction of tweets (over the entire corpus) have increased by 91.2{\%} and 42.6{\%} respectively. We then analyze the structure of the information diffusion network. We show that the distributions of the numbers of times a specific paper is tweeted, retweeted, and the number of connected components in the diffusion network are scale-free. These preliminary results suggest that, as for other kinds of information, there are underlying mechanisms that lead some scholars and their products to become viral.},

@article{Costas2014,
abstract = {‘Altmetrics’ (Priem et al., 2010) are regarded as a new way of expanding the analysis of impact of scientific activities (Wouters {\&} Costas, 2012) and research outputs (Piwowar, 2013). Previous studies have already demonstrated that altmetrics2 have only weak correlations with citations (Haustein et al., 2014a); Costas, Zahedi, {\&} Wouters, 2014; Waltman {\&} Costas, 2014). This lack of correlation suggests that these two metrics are probably capturing different dimensions of impact. Citations are normally linked to the idea of ‘scientific impact’3 . However, it is not defined what kind of impact do altmetrics capture? In this paper we intend to contribute to this debate by analyzing the content of the publications that have received some altmetric attention. The main objective is to explore the thematic orientation and content of scientific publications by their degree of ‘citedness’ or ‘altmetricness’. We propose the two following research questions: - What are the topics (i.e. subject categories) that have a higher density of altmetrics vs. citations? - Which terms (from the titles of the publications) have a higher density of altmetrics? Are there differences with terms with higher density of citations?},

@article{Bornmann2014,
abstract = {Many studies in information science have looked at the growth of science. In this study, we re-examine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (i) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (ii) analyse it across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data are analysed with an advanced statistical technique (segmented regression analysis) which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (1) The number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (2) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We have looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis we identified three growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1 percent up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3 percent up to the period between the two world wars and 8 to 9 percent to 2012.},

@article{Haustein2014,
abstract = {Presentation accepted at {\#}altmetrics14 {\#}WebSci14Introduction. In the fields of Physics, Mathematics and Computer science, depositing preprints or e-prints on arXiv is part of the publication cycle, as it provides access to papers, limits publication delays and establishes priority claims (Brooks, 2009). Between 1995 and 2011, about two-thirds of all arXiv e-prints could be matched to a journal article indexed in the Web of Science (Larivi{\`{e}}re et al., 2014). However, very little is known about the dissemination of these two versions across social media. The microblogging service Twitter has been identified as a tool used by academics and the general public to distribute, among other things, links to scholarly documents (Thelwall et al., 2013). Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the majority of tweets related to a scientific document appear shortly after its online availability, reaching a peak of activity much faster than citations and downloads (Eysenbach, 2011; Shuai, Pepe {\&} Bollen, 2012). This suggests that an important share of tweets to papers in Physics, Computer science and Mathematics are likely to be made to the arXiv rather than the published version of the paper. This study investigates the challenges of measuring Twitter activity to the journal of record and arXiv versions of scientific documents.},
