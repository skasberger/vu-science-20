regular-lattice and random-lattice behavior in social networks of increasing
size. We contend that the model displays a normal continuous phase transition
with a divergent correlation length as the degree of randomness tends to zero.
We propose a real-space renormalization group transformation for the model and
demonstrate that the transformation is exact in the limit of large system size.
We use this result to calculate the exact value of the single critical exponent
for the system, and to derive the scaling form for the average number of
\"degrees of separation\" between two nodes on the network as a function of the
three independent variables. We confirm our results by extensive numerical
simulation.

papers, showing its appeareance in a variety of systems. However, some big
holes still remain to be filled, as the commonly adopted mathematical
formulation suffers from a variety of limitations, that make it unsuitable to
provide a general tool of analysis for real networks, and not just for
mathematical (topological) abstractions. In this paper we show where the major
problems arise, and how there is therefore the need for a new reformulation of
the small-world concept. Together with an analysis of the variables involved,
we then propose a new theory of small-world networks based on two leading
concepts: efficiency and cost. Efficiency measures how well information
propagates over the network, and cost measures how expensive it is to build a
network. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of
{\em economic small worlds}, that formalizes the idea of networks that are
\"cheap\" to build, and nevertheless efficient in propagating information, both
at global and local scale. This new concept is shown to overcome all the
limitations proper of the so-far commonly adopted formulation, and to provide
an adequate tool to quantitatively analyze the behaviour of complex networks in
the real world. Various complex systems are analyzed, ranging from the realm of
neural networks, to social sciences, to communication and transportation
networks. In each case, economic small worlds are found. Moreover, using the
economic small-world framework, the construction principles of these networks
can be quantitatively analyzed and compared, giving good insights on how
efficiency and economy principles combine up to shape all these systems.

formation of ``social capital''. It is believed that societies with more social
capital are more democratic and economically developed than societies with
little social capital. However, social capital is a concept hard to quantify

\"web of trust'' between users of the \"Pretty-Good-Privacy\" (PGP) encryption
algorithm, which is used in digital communication to ``sign'' documents so that
the recipient knows for sure who the author is. Our analysis reveals the
coexistence in the web of trust of a macro scale-free structure with micro
strongly-connected cells in a complex network. We also show that when this

disintegrates and that the resulting network is partitioned into a large number

structural properties of social networks. The social network is conceived of as
being generated by a bipartite graph, in which actors are linked together via
multiple interaction contexts or affiliations. We discuss three principal
missing data mechanisms: network boundary specification (non-inclusion of
actors or affiliations), survey non-response, and censoring by vertex degree
(fixed choice design), examining their impact on the scientific collaboration
network from the Los Alamos E-print Archive as well as random bipartite graphs.
The results show that network boundary specification and fixed choice designs
can dramatically alter estimates of network-level statistics. The observed
clustering and assortativity coefficients are overestimated via omission of
interaction contexts (affiliations) or fixed choice of affiliations, and
underestimated via actor non-response, which results in inflated measurement
error. We also find that social networks with multiple interaction contexts
have certain surprising properties due to the presence of overlapping cliques.
In particular, assortativity by degree does not necessarily improve network
robustness to random omission of nodes as predicted by current theory.

in many domains and disciplines. This problem is relevant for social tasks
(objective analysis of relationships on the web), biological inquiries
(functional studies in metabolic, cellular or protein networks) or
technological problems (optimization of large infrastructures). Several types
of algorithm exist for revealing the community structure in networks, but a
general and quantitative definition of community is still lacking, leading to
an intrinsic difficulty in the interpretation of the results of the algorithms
without any additional non-topological information. In this paper we face this
problem by introducing two quantitative definitions of community and by showing
how they are implemented in practice in the existing algorithms. In this way
the algorithms for the identification of the community structure become fully
self-contained. Furthermore, we propose a new local algorithm to detect
communities which outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to the
computational cost, keeping the same level of reliability. The new algorithm is
tested on artificial and real-world graphs. In particular we show the
application of the new algorithm to a network of scientific collaborations,
which, for its size, can not be attacked with the usual methods. This new class
of local algorithms could open the way to applications to large-scale
technological and biological applications.

nested hierarchy of cognitive submodules that particularly, if not uniquely,
delineates human ecosystems. These modules, ranging from the immune system to
the local social network, are embedded in a cultural milieu which, to take the
perspective of the evolutionary anthropologist Robert Boyd, ''is as much a part
of human biology as the enamel on our teeth''. We begin by extending recent
treatments of cognitive process as associated with characteristic information
sources to a certain class of ecosystems through a generalization of
coarse-graining. In the spirit of the Large Deviations Program, we then import
renormalization formalism via the Asymptotic Equipartition Theorem to obtain
punctuated response to parameters of increasing habitat degradation. A Legendre
transform of an appropriate joint information permits analysis away from
critical points, and generates the expected quasi-stability in a highly natural
manner. We interweave the discussion with applications to the public health
impacts of the massive deurbanization and deindustrialization presently
afflicting the United States.

  and Agent Based Computational Economics","  We explore the effects of social influence in a simple market model in which
a large number of agents face a binary choice: 'to buy/not to buy' a single
unit of a product at a price posted by a single seller (the monopoly case). We
consider the case of 'positive externalities': an agent is more willing to buy
if the other agents with whom he/she interacts make the same decision.
  We compare two special cases known in the economics literature as the
Thurstone and the McFadden approaches. We show that they correspond to modeling
the heterogenity in individual decision rules with, respectively, annealed and
quenched disorder. More precisely the first case leads to a standard Ising
model at finite temperature in a uniform external field, and the second case to
a random field Ising model (RFIM) at zero temperature.
  Considering the optimisation of profit by the seller within the McFadden/RFIM
model in the mean field limit, we exhibit a new first order phase transition:
if the social influence is strong enough, there is a regime where, if the mean
willingness to pay increases, or if the production costs decrease, the optimal
solution for the seller jumps from one with a high price and a small number of
buyers, to another one with a low price and a large number of buyers.

  (discussion paper)","  The public sector comprises government agencies, ministries, education
institutions, health providers and other types of government, commercial and
not-for-profit organisations. Unlike commercial enterprises, this environment
is highly heterogeneous in all aspects. This forms a complex network which is
not always optimised. A lack of optimisation and communication hinders
information sharing between the network nodes limiting the flow of information.
Another limiting aspect is privacy of personal information and security of
operations of some nodes or segments of the network. Attempts to reorganise the
network or improve communications to make more information available for
sharing and analysis may be hindered or completely halted by public concerns
over privacy, political agendas, social and technological barriers. This paper
discusses a technical solution for information sharing while addressing the
privacy concerns with no need for reorganisation of the existing public sector
infrastructure . The solution is based on imposing an additional layer of
Intelligent Software Agents and Knowledge Bases for data mining and analysis.

users' trusted networks of friends in cyberspace. We routinely use our social
networks to judge the trustworthiness of outsiders, i.e., to decide where to
buy our next car, or to find a good mechanic for it. In this work, we show that
an email user may similarly use his email network, constructed solely from
sender and recipient information available in the email headers, to distinguish
between unsolicited commercial emails, commonly called \"spam\", and emails
associated with his circles of friends. We exploit the properties of social
networks to construct an automated anti-spam tool which processes an individual
user's personal email network to simultaneously identify the user's core
trusted networks of friends, as well as subnetworks generated by spams. In our
empirical studies of individual mail boxes, our algorithm classified
approximately 53% of all emails as spam or non-spam, with 100% accuracy. Some
of the emails are left unclassified by this network analysis tool. However, one
can exploit two of the following useful features. First, it requires no user
intervention or supervised training; second, it results in no false negatives
i.e., spam being misclassified as non-spam, or vice versa. We demonstrate that
these two features suggest that our algorithm may be used as a platform for a
comprehensive solution to the spam problem when used in concert with more
sophisticated, but more cumbersome, content-based filters.

method of analyzing the spread of epidemic processes of grippe and acute
respiratory track infections (ARTI) by means of the theory of discrete
non-Markov stochastic processes. We use the results of our last theory (Phys.
Rev. E 65, 046107 (2002)) to study statistical memory effects, long - range

dynamics of human ARTI infections and grippe. We have carried out the
comparative analysis of the data of the two infections (grippe and ARTI) in one

experimental data are analyzed by the power spectra of the initial time
correlation function and the memory functions of junior orders, the phase
portraits of the four first dynamic variables, the three first points of the
statistical non-Markov parameter and the locally averaged kinetic and
relaxation parameters. The received results give an opportunity to provide
strict quantitative description of the regular and stochastic components in
epidemic dynamics of social networks taking into account their time
discreteness and effects of statistical memory. They also allow to reveal the
degree of randomness and predictability of the real epidemic process in the

across several countries and years shows that productivity follows a
non-Gaussian distribution with power law tails. We demonstrate that these
empirical findings can be interpreted as consequence of a mechanism of
exchanges in a social network where firms improve their productivity by direct
innovation or/and by imitation of other firm's technological and organizational
solutions. The type of network-connectivity determines how fast and how
efficiently information can diffuse and how quickly innovation will permeate or
behaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation flow through a complex
network we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are
proportional to the connectivity of the network of links between firms. The
comparison with the empirical distributions reveals that such a network must be
of a scale-free type with a power-law degree distribution in the large
connectivity range.

  Complex Networks","  We present an extensive study of the foreshock and aftershock signatures
accompanying peaks of book sales. The time series of book sales are derived
from the ranking system of Amazon.com. We present two independent ways of
classifying peaks, one based on the acceleration pattern of sales and the other
based on the exponent of the relaxation. They are found to be consistent and
reveal the co-existence of two types of sales peaks: exogenous peaks occur
abruptly and are followed by a power law relaxation, while endogenous sale
peaks occur after a progressively accelerating power law growth followed by an
approximately symmetrical power law relaxation which is slower than for
exogenous peaks. We develop a simple epidemic model of buyers connected within
a network of acquaintances which propagates rumors and opinions on books. The
comparison between the predictions of the model and the empirical data confirms
the validity of the model and suggests in addition that social networks have
evolved to converge very close to criticality (here in the sense of critical
branching processes of opinion spreading). We test in details the evidence for
a power law distribution of book sales and confirm a previous indirect study
suggesting that the fraction of books (density distribution) $P(S)$ of sales S

library conferences were held that year, awareness of the World Wide Web was
accelerating, and the National Science Foundation awarded $24 Million (U.S.)

the DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to
the co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital
library conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional
network model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract
several established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional
network model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define
$AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the
network. The results are validated against conference program committee members
in the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and
AuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also
investigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint

real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the Internet, energy
landscapes, biological and social networks
\cite{ab-review,mendes,vespignani,newman,amaral}. A large number of real
networks are called ``scale-free'' because they show a power-law distribution
of the number of links per node \cite{ab-review,barabasi1999,faloutsos}.
However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not {\it length-scale}
invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the ``small-world''
property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases
exponentially with the ``diameter'' of the network
\cite{erdos,bollobas,milgram,watts}, rather than the power-law relation
expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel
approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is
indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a
renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing
nodes within a given \"size\". Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation
between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box
defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which
are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction
networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in
complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse
networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together
previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with
renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.

intracommunities (intercommunities) are strongly (weakly) tied, the BBS network
contains hub members who participate in many boards simultaneously but are
strongly tied, that is, they have a large degree and betweenness centrality and
provide communication channels between communities. On the other hand,
intracommunities are rather homogeneously and weakly connected. Such a
structure, which has never been empirically characterized in the past, might
provide a new perspective on social opinion formation in this digital era.

possible divisions of a network, but direct application of this method using,
for instance, simulated annealing is computationally costly. Here we show that
the modularity can be reformulated in terms of the eigenvectors of a new
characteristic matrix for the network, which we call the modularity matrix, and
that this reformulation leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection
that returns results of better quality than competing methods in noticeably
shorter running times. We demonstrate the algorithm with applications to
several network data sets.

models divide into two classes, those in which individuals form their beliefs
based on the opinions of their neighbors in a social network of personal
acquaintances, and those in which, conversely, network connections form between
individuals of similar beliefs. While both of these processes can give rise to
realistic levels of agreement between acquaintances, practical experience
suggests that opinion formation in the real world is not a result of one
process or the other, but a combination of the two. Here we present a simple
model of this combination, with a single parameter controlling the balance of
the two processes. We find that the model undergoes a continuous phase
transition as this parameter is varied, from a regime in which opinions are
arbitrarily diverse to one in which most individuals hold the same opinion. We
characterize the static and dynamical properties of this transition.

social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered
patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a
large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy
tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena,
and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over
long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about
trends over time.
  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising
phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of
edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average
distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional
wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of
the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).
  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even
at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest
fire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires
very few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs
exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the
present study.
  We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition
between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing
distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.

the internet -- are only partially known and available to us. While the process
of exploring such networks in many cases resembles a random walk, it becomes a
key issue to investigate and characterize how effectively the nodes and edges
of such networks can be covered by different strategies. At the same time, it
is critically important to infer how well can topological measurements such as
the average node degree and average clustering coefficient be estimated during
such network explorations. The present article addresses these problems by
considering random and Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) network models with varying
connectivity explored by three types of random walks: traditional, preferential
to untracked edges, and preferential to unvisited nodes. A series of relevant
results are obtained, including the fact that random and BA models with the
same size and average node degree allow similar node and edge coverage
efficiency, the identification of linear scaling with the size of the network
of the random walk step at which a given percentage of the nodes/edges is
covered, and the critical result that the estimation of the averaged node
degree and clustering coefficient by random walks on BA networks often leads to
heavily biased results. Many are the theoretical and practical implications of
such results.

We introduce a new index that satisfies two main properties. First, it can be

it distributes as a standard normal over all possible adjacency/weights

of the branching-deactivated geographical attachment preference that learned
from certain empirical evidence of social behaviors. It yields high clustering
and spectrums of degree distribution ranging from algebraic to exponential,
average shortest path length ranging from linear to logarithmic. We observe
that the present networks fit well with small-world graphs and scale-free
networks in both limit cases (exponential and algebraic degree distribution
respectively), obviously lacking self-similar property under a length-scale
transformation. Interestingly, we find perfect topological fractal structure
emerges by a mixture of both algebraic and exponential degree distributions in
a wide range of parameter values. The results present a reliable connection
among small-world graphs, scale-free networks and topological fractal networks,

the number of common neighbors any two adjacent nodes have, which serves as a
useful local measure for identifying the interconnectedness of communities. We
report a positive correlation between the overlap and weight of a link, thus
providing strong quantitative evidence for the weak ties hypothesis, a central
concept in social network analysis. The percolation properties of the network
are found to depend on the type and order of removed links, and they can help
understand how the local structure of the network manifests itself at the

engineering practices. In particular, OSS projects are managed by a large
number of volunteers, working freely on the tasks they choose to undertake. OSS
projects also rarely rely on explicit system-level design, or on project plans
or schedules. Moreover, OSS developers work in arbitrary locations and
collaborate almost exclusively over the Internet, using simple tools such as
email and software code tracking databases (e.g. CVS). All the characteristics
above make OSS development akin to weaving a tapestry of heterogeneous
components. The OSS design process relies on various types of actors: people
with prescribed roles, but also elements coming from a variety of information
spaces (such as email and software code). The objective of our research is to
understand the specific hybrid weaving accomplished by the actors of this
distributed, collective design process. This, in turn, challenges traditional
methodologies used to understand distributed software engineering: OSS
development is simply too \"fibrous\" to lend itself well to analysis under a
single methodological lens. In this paper, we describe the methodological
framework we articulated to analyze collaborative design in the Open Source

of a project's hybrid network. We combine ethnography, text mining, and
socio-technical network analysis and visualization to understand OSS

Modular structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks, and its
detection is important because it gives insights in the structure-functionality
relationship. The standard approach is based on the optimization of a quality
function, modularity, which is a relative quality measure for a partition of a
network into modules. Recently some authors [1,2] have pointed out that the
optimization of modularity has a fundamental drawback: the existence of a
resolution limit beyond which no modular structure can be detected even though
these modules might have own entity. The reason is that several topological
descriptions of the network coexist at different scales, which is, in general,
a fingerprint of complex systems. Here we propose a method that allows for
multiple resolution screening of the modular structure. The method has been
validated using synthetic networks, discovering the predefined structures at
all scales. Its application to two real social networks allows to find the
exact splits reported in the literature, as well as the substructure beyond the
actual split.

examine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two
mechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media
influence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the
network of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,
where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of
interactions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing
that cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media
influence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action
(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of
the full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that
the enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media
only occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous
studies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in
combination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural
homogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are
more efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media
messages or indirect global mass media influences.

research fields by applying theories and methods originally developed in
physics in order to solve problems in economics, social science, biology,
medicine, technology, etc. In their turn, these different branches of science
inspire the invention of new concepts in physics. A basic tool of analysis, in
such a context, is the mathematical theory of complexity concerned with the
study of complex systems including human economies, climate, nervous systems,
cells and living things, including human beings, as well as modern energy or
communication infrastructures which are all networks of some kind. Recently,
complexity has become a natural domain of interest of the real world
socio-cognitive systems, linguistics, and emerging systemics research. The
phenomena to be studied and understood arise from neither the physical laws nor
the abstraction of mathematics. The challenge is to discern and formulate
plausible mathematical structures to describe problems that represent vague

religious beliefs emerge and disappear on scales from extreme subcultures to
mainstream mass-cultures. Both the underlying social structure and the
formation of opinions are dynamic and changes in one affect the other. Several
positive feedback mechanisms have been proposed to drive the diversity in
social and economic systems, but little effort has been devoted to pinpoint the
interplay between a dynamically changing social network and the spread and
gathering of information on the network. Here we analyze this phenomenon in
terms of a social network-model that explicitly simulates the feedback between
information assembly and emergence of social structures: changing beliefs are
coupled to changing relationships because agents self-organize a dynamic
network to facilitate their hunter-gatherer behavior in information space. Our
analysis demonstrates that tribal organizations and modular social networks can
emerge as a result of contact-seeking agents that reinforce their beliefs among
like-minded. We also find that prestigious persons can streamline the social
network into hierarchical structures around themselves.

understanding the organization of various real-world networks and has
applications in problems as diverse as consensus formation in social
communities or the identification of functional modules in biochemical
networks. Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in
large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number
and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we
investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network
structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a pre-defined
objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our
algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each
node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this
iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a
unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to
networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the
algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less
expensive than what was possible so far.

structural growth and weight dynamics are driven by human behavior, i.e.
passenger route choice behavior. Transportation networks grow due to people's
increasing travel demand and the pattern of growth is determined by their route
choice behavior. In airline networks passengers often transfer from a third
airport instead of flying directly to the destination, which contributes to the
hubs formation and finally the scale-free statistical property. In this model
we assume at each time step there emerges a new node with m travel
destinations. Then the new node either connects destination directly with the
probability p or transfers from a third node with the probability 1-p. The
analytical result shows degree and strength both obey power-law distribution
with the exponent between 2.33 and 3 depending on p. The weights also obey
power-law distribution. The clustering coefficient, degree assortatively
coefficient and degree-strength correlation are all dependent on the
probability p. This model can also be used in social networks.

such as Digg, Flickr, and Del.icio.us allow users to designate others as
\"friends\" or \"contacts\" and provide a single-click interface to track friends'
activity. How are these social networks used? Unlike pure social networking
sites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their
online professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for
the most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships.
Instead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express
their tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new
submissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate
new ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing. Through
an extensive analysis of data from Digg and Flickr, we show that social
browsing is one of the primary usage modalities on these social media sites.

Apart from the small-world nature, we found that proteins have another general

page with several outgoing links you could choose to follow. Which link should
you choose in such an online scenario? When you are not sure where the
information you require resides, you will initiate a navigation session. This
involves pruning some of the links and following one of the others, where more
pruning is likely to happen the deeper you navigate. In terms of decision
making, the utility of navigation diminishes with distance until finally the
utility drops to zero and the session is terminated. Under this model of
navigation, we call the number of nodes that are available after pruning, for
browsing within a session, the {\em potential gain} of the starting web page.
Thus the parameters that effect the potential gain are the local branching
factor with respect to the starting web page and the discount factor.
  We first consider the case when the discounting factor is geometric. We show
that the distribution of the effective number of links that the user can follow
at each navigation step after pruning, i.e. the number of nodes added to the
potential gain at that step, is given by the {\em erf} function. We derive an
approximation to the potential gain of a web page and show that this is
numerically a very accurate estimate. We then consider a harmonic discounting
factor and show that, in this case, the potential gain at each step is closely
related to the probability density function for the Poisson distribution.
  The potential gain has been applied to web navigation where it helps the user
to choose a good starting point for initiating a navigation session. Another
application is in social network analysis, where the potential gain could
provide a novel measure of centrality.

particular, assuming that a linear multiuser detector is adopted in the uplink
receiver, the case considered is that in which each terminal is allowed to vary
its transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize
its own utility, which is defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit
power. Resorting to a game-theoretic formulation, a non-cooperative game for
utility maximization is formulated, and it is proved that a unique Nash
equilibrium exists, which, under certain conditions, is also Pareto-optimal.
Theoretical results concerning the relationship between the problems of SINR
maximization and MSE minimization are given, and, resorting to the tools of
large system analysis, a new distributed power control algorithm is
implemented, based on very little prior information about the user of interest.
The utility profile achieved by the active users in a large CDMA system is also
computed, and, moreover, the centralized socially optimum solution is analyzed.
Considerations on the extension of the proposed framework to a multi-cell
scenario are also briefly detailed. Simulation results confirm that the
proposed non-cooperative game largely outperforms competing alternatives, and
that it exhibits a quite small performance loss with respect to the socially
optimum solution, and only in the case in which the users number exceeds the
processing gain. Finally, results also show an excellent agreement between the
theoretical closed-form formulas based on large system analysis and the outcome
of numerical experiments.

asset market. We consider a combination of social interaction within peer
groups and individually heterogeneous fundamentalist trading decisions which
take into account the market price and the perceived fundamental value of the
asset. The resulting excess demand is coupled to the market price. Rigorous
analysis reveals that this feedback may lead to price oscillations, a single
bounce, or monotonic price behaviour. The model is a rare example of an
analytically tractable interacting-agent model which allows us to deduce in

automatic tools are required to get a synthetic view of the graph and to reach
a good understanding of the underlying problem. In particular, discovering
groups of tightly connected vertices and understanding the relations between
those groups is very important in practice. This paper shows how a kernel
version of the batch Self Organizing Map can be used to achieve these goals via
kernels derived from the Laplacian matrix of the graph, especially when it is
used in conjunction with more classical methods based on the spectral analysis
of the graph. The proposed method is used to explore the structure of a

  overlapping communities","  Complex networks topologies present interesting and surprising properties,
such as community structures, which can be exploited to optimize communication,
to find new efficient and context-aware routing algorithms or simply to
understand the dynamics and meaning of relationships among nodes. Complex
networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a
powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological
and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of
nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from
the definition of modularity function, given by M. Newman to evaluate the
goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more
general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures.
Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for
finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to
benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new dataset which could
be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures
identification.

relaxation governing the timing of views. We find that these relaxation
exponents cluster into three distinct classes, and allow for the classification
of collective human dynamics. This is consistent with an epidemic model on a
social network containing two ingredients: A power law distribution of waiting

cause of future actions. This model is a conceptual extension of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to social systems, and provides a unique
framework for the investigation of timing in complex systems.

multiple correlated sources where each terminal wants to losslessly reconstruct
all the sources. We study the inefficiency brought forth by the selfish
behavior of the terminals in this scenario by modeling it as a noncooperative
game among the terminals. The degradation in performance due to the lack of
regulation is measured by the {\it Price of Anarchy} (POA), which is defined as
the ratio between the cost of the worst possible \textit{Wardrop equilibrium}
and the socially optimum cost. Our main result is that in contrast with the
case of independent sources, the presence of source correlations can
significantly increase the price of anarchy. Towards establishing this result,
we first characterize the socially optimal flow and rate allocation in terms of
four intuitive conditions. Next, we show that the Wardrop equilibrium is a
socially optimal solution for a different set of (related) cost functions.
Using this, we construct explicit examples that demonstrate that the POA $> 1$
and determine near-tight upper bounds on the POA as well. The main techniques
in our analysis are Lagrangian duality theory and the usage of the
supermodularity of conditional entropy.

incentives of self-interested agents with the objectives of a system designer.
There is, however, a fundamental disconnect between the traditional application
domains of mechanism design (such as auctions) and those arising in computer
science (such as networks): while monetary transfers (i.e., payments) are
essential for most of the known positive results in mechanism design, they are
undesirable or even technologically infeasible in many computer systems.
Classical impossibility results imply that the reach of mechanisms without
transfers is severely limited.
  Computer systems typically do have the ability to reduce service
quality--routing systems can drop or delay traffic, scheduling protocols can
delay the release of jobs, and computational payment schemes can require
computational payments from users (e.g., in spam-fighting systems). Service
degradation is tantamount to requiring that users burn money}, and such
``payments'' can be used to influence the preferences of the agents at a cost
of degrading the social surplus.
  We develop a framework for the design and analysis of money-burning
mechanisms to maximize the residual surplus--the total value of the chosen
outcome minus the payments required.

interacting agents on networks present interesting questions of general
interest from physics to sociology. We present a quantitative analysis of a
case implying an evolving small size network, i.e. that inherent to the ongoing
debate between modern creationists (most are Intelligent Design (ID) proponents
(IDP)) and Darwin's theory of Evolution Defenders (DED)). This study is carried
out by analyzing the structural properties of the citation network unfolded in
the recent decades by publishing works belonging to members of the two
communities. With the aim of capturing the dynamical aspects of the interaction
between the IDP and DED groups, we focus on $two$ key quantities, namely, the
{\it degree of activity} of each group and the corresponding {\it degree of
impact} on the intellectual community at large. A representative measure of the
former is provided by the {\it rate of production of publications} (RPP),
whilst the latter can be assimilated to the{\it rate of increase in citations}
(RIC). These quantities are determined, respectively, by the slope of the time
series obtained for the number of publications accumulated per year and by the
slope of a similar time series obtained for the corresponding citations. The
results indicate that in this case, the dynamics can be seen as geared by
triggered or damped competition. The network is a specific example of marked
heterogeneity in exchange of information activity in and between the
communities, particularly demonstrated through the nodes having a high
connectivity degree, i.e. opinion leaders.

to allow for disconnected equilibrium networks. There are n players, each is a
vertex in a graph, and a strategy is a subset of players to build edges to. For
each edge a player must pay a cost \alpha, and the individual cost for a player
represents a trade-off between edge costs and shortest path lengths to all
other players. We extend the model to a penalized game (PCG), for which we
reduce the penalty counted towards the individual cost for a pair of
disconnected players to a finite value \beta. Our analysis concentrates on
existence, structure, and cost of disconnected Nash and strong equilibria.
Although the PCG is not a potential game, pure Nash equilibria always and pure
strong equilibria very often exist. We provide tight conditions under which
disconnected Nash (strong) equilibria can evolve. Components of these
equilibria must be Nash (strong) equilibria of a smaller NCG. However, in
contrast to the NCG, for almost all parameter values no tree is a stable
component. Finally, we present a detailed characterization of the price of
anarchy that reveals cases in which the price of anarchy is \Theta(n) and thus
several orders of magnitude larger than in the NCG. Perhaps surprisingly, the
strong price of anarchy increases to at most 4. This indicates that global
communication and coordination can be extremely valuable to overcome socially
inferior topologies in distributed selfish network design.

led to the renewal of interest in automatic community detection methods.
Surprisingly, there is no universally accepted definition of the community. One
frequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or
better-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut
edges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].
This definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community
detection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher
than expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative
definition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have
more influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We
present a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based
modularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into
communities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in
literature, and found that it often outperforms the edge-based modularity
algorithm.

audience. With content fast becoming a commodity, interest in using social
networks to promote and find content has grown, both on the side of content
producers (viral marketing) and consumers (recommendation). Here we study the
role of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator
that allows users to submit links to and vote on news stories. Digg's goal is
to feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates
opinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking
sites, Digg allows users to designate other users as ``friends'' and see what
stories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news
stories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the
spread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the
story will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's
neighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through
submitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is
visible already in the early stages of voting, and one can make a prediction
about the potential audience of a story simply by analyzing where the initial
votes come from.

information to spread from one node to another -- a concept that draws on the
notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We
find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not
apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we
define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which
information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone
is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and
long-range bridges -- a finding that sheds new light on the relationship
between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.

scale-free networks. While several empirical studies exist, there is no general
theoretical analysis that can explain the largely varying behavior of real
networks. Here, we use scaling theory to quantify the degree of correlations in
the particular case of networks with a power-law degree distribution. These
networks are classified in terms of their correlation properties, revealing
additional information on their structure. For instance, the studied social
networks and the Internet at the router level are clustered around the line of
random networks, implying a strongly connected core of hubs. On the contrary,
some biological networks and the WWW exhibit strong anti-correlations. The
present approach can be used to study robustness or diffusion, where we find
that anti-correlations tend to accelerate the diffusion process.

communities in social and information networks. We explore from a novel
perspective several questions related to identifying meaningful communities in
large social and information networks, and we come to several striking
conclusions. We employ approximation algorithms for the graph partitioning
problem to characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural
properties of partitions of graphs that could plausibly be interpreted as
communities. In particular, we define the network community profile plot, which
characterizes the \"best\" possible community--according to the conductance
measure--over a wide range of size scales. We study over 100 large real-world
social and information networks. Our results suggest a significantly more
refined picture of community structure in large networks than has been
appreciated previously. In particular, we observe tight communities that are
barely connected to the rest of the network at very small size scales; and
communities of larger size scales gradually \"blend into\" the expander-like core
of the network and thus become less \"community-like.\" This behavior is not
explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network
generation models. Moreover, it is exactly the opposite of what one would
expect based on intuition from expander graphs, low-dimensional or
manifold-like graphs, and from small social networks that have served as
testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found that a generative
graph model, in which new edges are added via an iterative \"forest fire\"
burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community
profile plot similar to what we observe in our network datasets.

messages are broadcast or sent via shortest paths; only connection density
matters. In contrast, homophily substantially slows learning based on repeated
averaging of neighbors' information and Markovian diffusion processes such as
the Google random surfer model. Indeed, the latter processes are strongly
affected by homophily but completely independent of connection density,
provided this density exceeds a low threshold. We obtain these results by
establishing new results on the spectra of large random graphs and relating the

would need to consider the role of \"overlapping communities.\" Despite some
efforts in this direction, the problem of detecting overlapping groups remains
unsolved because there is neither a formal definition of overlapping community,
nor an ensemble of networks with which to test the performance of group
detection algorithms when nodes can belong to more than one group. Here, we
introduce an ensemble of networks with overlapping groups. We then apply three
group identification methods--modularity maximization, k-clique percolation,
and modularity-landscape surveying--to these networks. We find that the
modularity-landscape surveying method is the only one able to detect
heterogeneities in node memberships, and that those heterogeneities are only

desirable to find natural partitions into communities that can act as
simplified descriptions and provide insight into the structure and function of
the overall system. Although community detection methods abound, there is a
lack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We
show here that the quality of a partition can be measured in terms of its
stability, defined in terms of the clustered autocovariance of a Markov process
taking place on the graph. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on
time scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each
time and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.
Hence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter
that establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our
framework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning
measures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step
time measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We
apply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions
over time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and
social networks. We also obtain reduced descriptions for atomic level protein
structures over different time scales.

degrees (the number of links a node has) are similar. For social networks, a
node's degree has been assumed to be a proxy for its importance/prominence
within the network, and the assortative behaviour is then interpreted as
indicating that people mix with people of comparable prominence. In this paper
we introduce a new property, second-order assortative mixing, which measures
the correlation between the most prominent neighbours of two connected nodes,
rather than the prominence of the nodes themselves. Five social networks and
six other networks are examined. We observe very stronge second-order
assortative mixing in social networks. This suggests that if two people
interact in a social network then the importance of the most prominent person
each knows is very likely to be the same. This is also true if we measure the
average prominence of neighbours of the two people. This property is weaker or
negative in non-social networks. We investigate a number of possible
explanations for this property, including statistical significance,
neighbourhood size, power-law degree distribution, cluster coefficient,
triangles and bipartite graphs. However, none of these properties was found to
provide an adequate explanation. We therefore conclude that second-order
assortative mixing is a fundamental property of social networks.

objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms
and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of
networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to
functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in
networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.
Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where
communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the
fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where
each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a
global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping
groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and
show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic
organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to
the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link
communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical
organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including
major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic
networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically
organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while
maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are
fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization
in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.

new possibilities for characterizing individual behavior and, by extension,
identifying latent structure in human populations. Here, we propose a model of
individual e-mail communication that is sufficiently rich to capture meaningful
variability across individuals, while remaining simple enough to be
interpretable. We show that the model, a cascading non-homogeneous Poisson
process, can be formulated as a double-chain hidden Markov model, allowing us
to use an efficient inference algorithm to estimate the model parameters from
observed data. We then apply this model to two e-mail data sets consisting of
404 and 6,164 users, respectively, that were collected from two universities in
different countries and years. We find that the resulting best-estimate
parameter distributions for both data sets are surprisingly similar, indicating
that at least some features of communication dynamics generalize beyond
specific contexts. We also find that variability of individual behavior over
time is significantly less than variability across the population, suggesting
that individuals can be classified into persistent \"types\". We conclude that
communication patterns may prove useful as an additional class of attribute
data, complementing demographic and network data, for user classification and
outlier detection--a point that we illustrate with an interpretable clustering
of users based on their inferred model parameters.

support this position we present a computer model of opinion formation based on
some novel assumptions, designed to bring the model closer to social reality.
In our model, the agents, in addition to changing their opinions due to
influence of the rest of society and external propaganda, have the ability to
modify their social network, forming links with agents sharing the same
opinions and cutting the links with those they disagree with. To improve the
model further we divide the agents into `fanatics' and `opportunists',
depending on how easy is to change their opinions. The simulations show
significant differences compared to traditional models, where network links are
static. In particular, for the dynamical model where inter-agent links are
adjustable, the final network structure and opinion distribution is shown to
resemble real world observations, such as social structures and persistence of
minority groups even when most of the society is against them and the
propaganda is strong.

algorithms usually project such networks unto simple graphs composed of
entities of a single type. In the process, they conflate relations between
entities of different types and loose important structural information. We
develop a mathematical framework that can be used to compactly represent and
analyze heterogeneous networks that combine multiple entity and link types. We
generalize Bonacich centrality, which measures connectivity between nodes by
the number of paths between them, to heterogeneous networks and use this
measure to study network structure. Specifically, we extend the popular
modularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality
metric. We also rank nodes based on their connectivity to other nodes. One
advantage of this centrality metric is that it has a tunable parameter we can
use to set the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings change
with this parameter allows us to identify important nodes in the network. We
apply the proposed method to analyze the structure of several heterogeneous
networks. We show that exploiting additional sources of evidence corresponding

link represents, for example, the control of one node over the other node or
unidirectional information flows. Some centrality measures are used to
determine the relative importance of nodes specifically in directed networks.
We analyze such a centrality measure called the influence. The influence
represents the importance of nodes in various dynamics such as synchronization,
evolutionary dynamics, random walk, and social dynamics. We analytically
calculate the influence in various networks, including directed multipartite
networks and a directed version of the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. The
global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts,
rather than local properties of the nodes, such as the degree, are shown to be
the chief determinants of the influence of nodes in many cases. The developed
method is also applicable to the calculation of the PageRank. We also
numerically show that in a coupled oscillator system, the threshold for
entrainment by a pacemaker is low when the pacemaker is placed on influential
nodes. For a type of random network, the analytically derived threshold is
approximately equal to the inverse of the influence. We numerically show that
this relationship also holds true in a random scale-free network and a neural
network.

  Filtering of Human Migration Flows between 3,000+ U. S. Counties","  To control for multiscale effects in networks, one can transform the matrix
of (in general) weighted, directed internodal flows to bistochastic
(doubly-stochastic) form, using the iterative proportional fitting
(Sinkhorn-Knopp) procedure, which alternatively scales row and column sums to
all equal 1. The dominant entries in the bistochasticized table can then be
employed for network reduction, using strong component hierarchical clustering.
We illustrate various facets of this well-established, widely-applied two-stage
algorithm with the 3, 107 x 3, 107 (asymmetric) 1995-2000 intercounty migration
flow table for the United States. We compare the results obtained with ones
using the disparity filter, for \"extracting the \"multiscale backbone of complex
weighted networks\", recently put forth by Serrano, Boguna and Vespignani (SBV)
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106 [2009], 6483), upon which we have briefly commented
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 106 [2009], E66). The performance of the bistochastic
filter appears to be superior-at least in this specific case-in two respects:
(1) it requires far fewer links to complete a stongly-connected network
backbone; and (2) it \"belittles\" small flows and nodes less-a principal
desideratum of SBV-in the sense that the correlations of the nonzero raw flows
are considerably weaker with the corresponding bistochastized links than with
the significance levels yielded by the disparity filter. Additional comparative
studies--as called for by SBV-of these two filtering procedures, in particular
as regards their topological properties, should be of considerable interest.
Relatedly, in its many geographic applications, the two-stage procedure
has--with rare exceptions-clustered contiguous areas, often reconstructing
traditional regions (islands, for example), even though no contiguity
constraints, at all, are imposed beforehand.

data may face obstacles. This is particularly true for the dynamic development
of community structure in citation networks. Namely, it is neither clear when
it is appropriate to employ existing community detection approaches nor is it
clear how to choose among existing approaches. Using simulated data, we attempt
to clarify the conditions under which one should use existing methods and which
of these algorithms is appropriate in a given context. We hope this paper will

observed through temporal series corresponding to units at different levels
(cities, regions, countries...). Units at a given local level may follow a
collective trend imposed by external conditions, but also may display
fluctuations of purely local origin. The local behavior is usually computed as
the difference between the local data and a global average (e.g. a national
average), a view point which can be very misleading. We propose here a method
for separating the local dynamics from the global trend in a collection of
correlated time series. We take an independent component analysis approach in
which we do not assume a small unbiased local contribution in contrast with
previously proposed methods. We first test our method on synthetic series
generated by correlated random walkers. We then consider crime rate series (in
the US and France) and the evolution of obesity rate in the US, which are two
important examples of societal measures. For crime rates, the separation
between global and local policies is a major subject of debate. For the US, we
observe large fluctuations in the transition period of mid-70's during which
crime rates increased significantly, whereas since the 80's, the state crime
rates are governed by external factors and the importance of local
specificities being decreasing. In the case of obesity, our method shows that
external factors dominate the evolution of obesity since 2000, and that
different states can have different dynamical behavior even if their obesity
prevalence is similar.

communicational behavior continues to be poorly understood. Here we investigate
the communication patterns in two social Internet communities in search of
statistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that
human communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also
explain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a
generalized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling
law between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and
their level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding
economic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its
origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns in
human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire period of the
available data of more than one year. Further, we provide a mathematical
framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's law to the long-term
correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same underlying mechanism could be
the source of Gibrat's law in economics, ranging from large firms, research and
development expenditures, gross domestic product of countries, to city
population growth. These findings are also of importance for designing
communication networks and for the understanding of the dynamics of social

a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously
socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We
have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players
over a period of three years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This
large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic
data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual
income through economic activities to `survive' and are typically engaged in a
multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of

differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative

network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication
networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of
the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the

Generally speaking, modules are islands of highly connected nodes separated by
a relatively small number of links. Every module can have contributions of
links from any node in the network. The challenge is to disentangle these
contributions to understand how the modular structure is built. The main
problem is that the analysis of a certain partition into modules involves, in

this challenge, here we first define the contribution matrix, the mathematical
object containing all the information about the partition of interest, and
after, we use a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition to extract the best
representation of this matrix in a plane. The analysis of this projection allow
us to scrutinize the skeleton of the modular structure, revealing the structure
of individual modules and their interrelations.

have been used widely in the information sciences. However, confusion and

underlying problem, in our opinion, involved understanding the nature of

the appropriate statistical techniques that can be applied to each of these

proximity matrix. The argument is illustrated with examples. The study then
extends the application of co-occurrence matrices to the Web environment where
the nature of the available data and thus data collection methods are different

demonstrate the application and value of our approach in a case study comparing
three research fields in chemistry. A mesoscopic level of analysis means that
in addition to the basic analytic unit of the individual researcher as node in
a co-author network, we base our analysis on the observed modular structure of
co-author networks. We interpret the clustering of authors into groups as
bibliometric footprints of the basic collective units of knowledge production
in a research specialty. We find two types of coauthor-linking patterns between
author clusters that we interpret as representing two different forms of
cooperative behavior, transfer-type connections due to career migrations or
one-off services rendered, and stronger, dedicated inter-group collaboration.
Hence the generic coauthor network of a research specialty can be understood as
the overlay of two distinct types of cooperative networks between groups of
authors publishing in a research specialty. We show how our analytic approach
exposes field specific differences in the social organization of research.

  Partitions and Exploring Data Graphs Locally","  The second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvector
are fundamental features of an undirected graph, and as such they have found
widespread use in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. In
many applications, however, graphs that arise have several \emph{local} regions
of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide
information fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a
locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its
usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised
manner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a
constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as
an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new
problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a
Personalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the
solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this
locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best
partition \emph{near} an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in
which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an
approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive
is useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as it allows us to
focus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we
provide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can
applied to finding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set
in social and information networks.

seismology is more internationalised than geophysics: in 2000, seismology had a
lower percentage of all articles co-authored on an international basis.
Nevertheless, social network analysis shows that the core group of cooperating
countries within seismology is proportionately larger and more distributed than
that within geophysics. While the latter exhibits an established network with a
hierarchy, the formation of a field in terms of new partnership relations is
ongoing in seismology.

major goals would be to find a connection between the statistical laws to the
microscopic properties: for example to understand the nature of the microscopic
interactions or to point out the existence of interaction networks. The
probability theory suggests the existence of few classes of stationary
distributions in the thermodynamics limit, so that the question is if a
statistical physics approach could be able to enroll the complex nature of the
social systems. We have analyzed a large GPS data base for single vehicle
mobility in the Florence urban area, obtaining statistical laws for path
lengths, for activity downtimes and for activity degrees. We show also that
simple generic assumptions on the microscopic behavior could explain the
existence of stationary macroscopic laws, with an universal function describing

requires dynamical data-base for the microscopic evolution, that allow to solve
both small space and time scales in order to study the transients.

  Communities","  The diffusion of information and behaviors over social networks is of
considerable interest in research fields ranging from sociology to computer
science and application domains such as marketing, finance, human health, and
national security. Of particular interest is the possibility to develop
predictive capabilities for social diffusion, for instance enabling early
identification of diffusion processes which are likely to become \"viral\" and
propagate to a significant fraction of the population. Recently we have shown,
using theoretical analysis, that the dynamics of social diffusion may depend
crucially upon the interactions of social network communities, that is, densely
connected groupings of individuals which have only relatively few links between
groups. This paper presents an empirical investigation of two related
hypotheses which follow from this finding: 1.) inter-community interaction is
predictive of the reach of social diffusion and 2.) dispersion of the diffusion
phenomenon across network communities is a useful early indicator that the
propagation will be \"successful\". We explore these hypotheses with case studies
involving the emergence of the Swedish Social Democratic Party at the turn of
the 20th century, the spread of the SARS virus in 2002-2003, and blogging
dynamics associated with real world protest activity. These empirical studies
demonstrate that network community-based diffusion metrics do indeed possess
predictive power, and in fact can be more useful than standard measures.

study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation.
Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in
social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an
active network community and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort
moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past
decade has seen a burgeoning network literature in statistical physics and
computer science. The growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online
networking communities such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, and a host of
more specialized professional network communities has intensified interest in
the study of networks and network data. Our goal in this review is to provide
the reader with an entry point to this burgeoning literature. We begin with an
overview of the historical development of statistical network modeling and then
we introduce a number of examples that have been studied in the network
literature. Our subsequent discussion focuses on a number of prominent static
and dynamic network models and their interconnections. We emphasize formal

  networks","  As a social media, online social networks play a vital role in the social
information diffusion. However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of
the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other
types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been
done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of
online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to
investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social
networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on
large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous
research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make
the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal.
However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the
information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also
give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments.
Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information

  Internet","  An important aspect of the Future Internet is the efficient utilization of
(wireless) network resources. In order for the - demanding in terms of QoS -
Future Internet services to be provided, the current trend is evolving towards
an \"integrated\" wireless network access model that enables users to enjoy
mobility, seamless access and high quality of service in an all-IP network on
an \"Anytime, Anywhere\" basis. The term \"integrated\" is used to denote that the
Future Internet wireless \"last mile\" is expected to comprise multiple
heterogeneous geographically coexisting wireless networks, each having
different capacity and coverage radius. The efficient management of the
wireless access network resources is crucial due to their scarcity that renders
wireless access a potential bottleneck for the provision of high quality
services. In this paper we propose an auction mechanism for allocating the
bandwidth of such a network so that efficiency is attained, i.e. social welfare
is maximized. In particular, we propose an incentive-compatible, efficient
auction-based mechanism of low computational complexity. We define a repeated
game to address user utilities and incentives issues. Subsequently, we extend
this mechanism so that it can also accommodate multicast sessions. We also
analyze the computational complexity and message overhead of the proposed
mechanism. We then show how user bids can be replaced from weights generated by
the network and transform the auction to a cooperative mechanism capable of
prioritizing certain classes of services and emulating DiffServ and time-of-day
pricing schemes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by simulations that
assess the proposed mechanisms properties and performance. We finally provide
some concluding remarks and directions for future research.

are spread, and infectious diseases propagate within a society. Identifying the
most efficient \"spreaders\" in a network is an important step to optimize the
use of available resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information.
Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders
in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the
most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The
most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as
identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders
are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial
parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find
that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered
individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network
under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our
analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient
dissemination strategies.

probability of activation for each node in the social network. We then provide
an equivalent interpretation for the influence spread, in terms of acyclic path

structure is important and urgent. In this paper, we use the eigenvectors'
stability to characterize the significance of community structures. By
employing the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of a given network, we can
evaluate the significance of its community structure and obtain the optimal
number of communities, which are always hard for community detection
algorithms. We apply our method to many real networks. We find that significant
community structures exist in many social networks and C.elegans neural

protein-interaction networks and metabolic networks. Our method can be applied

larger groups. For many groups however, there is no list of members from which
to take a random sample. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new
sampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty by using the social
networks of the groups under study. The RDS method has been shown to provide
unbiased estimates of population proportions given certain conditions. The
method is now widely used in the study of HIV-related high-risk populations
globally. In this paper, we test the RDS methodology by simulating RDS studies
on the social networks of a large LGBT web community. The robustness of the RDS
method is tested by violating, one by one, the conditions under which the
method provides unbiased estimates. Results reveal that the risk of bias is
large if networks are directed, or respondents choose to invite persons based
on characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. If these two
problems are absent, the RDS method shows strong resistance to low response
rates and certain errors in the participants' reporting of their network sizes.
Other issues that might affect the RDS estimates, such as the method for
choosing initial participants, the maximum number of recruitments per
participant, sampling with or without replacement and variations in network
structures, are also simulated and discussed.

because their open-ended nature allows users to create light-weight semantic
scaffolding to organize and share content. To date, the interplay of the social
and semantic components of social media has been only partially explored. Here
we focus on Flickr and Last.fm, two social media systems in which we can relate
the tagging activity of the users with an explicit representation of their
social network. We show that a substantial level of local lexical and topical
alignment is observable among users who lie close to each other in the social
network. We introduce a null model that preserves user activity while removing
local correlations, allowing us to disentangle the actual local alignment
between users from statistical effects due to the assortative mixing of user
activity and centrality in the social network. This analysis suggests that
users with similar topical interests are more likely to be friends, and
therefore semantic similarity measures among users based solely on their
annotation metadata should be predictive of social links. We test this
hypothesis on the Last.fm data set, confirming that the social network
constructed from semantic similarity captures actual friendship more accurately
than Last.fm's suggestions based on listening patterns.

social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive

structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them.
However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was
not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from
one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of
information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it.
We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites.
Specifically, we extract social networks of active users on Digg and Twitter,
and track how interest in news stories spreads among them. We show that social
networks play a crucial role in the spread of information on these sites, and

weaved a network of reinforcing feedbacks that led to a widespread endorsement
and extraordinary commitment by those involved in the project, beyond what
would be rationalized by a standard cost-benefit analysis in the presence of
extraordinary uncertainties and risks. The vigorous competition and race
between the initially public project and several private initiatives is argued
to support the social bubble hypothesis. We also present quantitative analyses
of the concomitant financial bubble concentrated on the biotech sector.
Confirmation of this hypothesis is offered by the present consensus that it
will take decades to exploit the fruits of the HGP, via a slow and arduous
process aiming at disentangling the extraordinary complexity of the human
complex body. The HGP has ushered other initiatives, based on the recognition
that there is much that genomics cannot do, and that \"the future belongs to
proteomics\". We present evidence that the competition between the public and
private sector actually played in favor of the former, since its financial
burden as well as its horizon was significantly reduced (for a long time
against its will) by the active role of the later. This suggests that
governments can take advantage of the social bubble mechanism to catalyze

demonstrate the composability of different models generated using An\'onimos, a

proximity or locality. There is a need to augment such systems with
proximity-based systems for more immediate response to attempt to prevent and
deter crime. In this paper we propose SHIELD, an on-campus emergency rescue and
alert management service. It is a fully distributed infrastructure-less
platform based on proximity-enabled trust and cooperation. It relies on
localized responses, sent using Bluetooth and/or WiFi on the fly to achieve
minimal response time and maximal availability thereby augmenting the
traditional notion of emergency services. Analysis of campus crime statistics
and WLAN traces surprisingly show a strong positive correlation (over 55%)
between on-campus crime statistics and spatio-temporal density distribution of
on-campus mobile users. This result provides a motivation to develop such
platform and points to the promise in reducing crime incidences. We also show
an implementation of a prototype application to be used in such scenarios.

We show that, generically, all of these are confounded with each other.
Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the
parametrization of the social process or on the adequacy of the covariates used

in multi-way arrays is ubiquitous in biomedical signal processing, network
traffic analysis, bibliometrics, social network analysis, chemometrics,
computer vision, communication networks, etc. We consider the problem of how to
factorize data sets with missing values with the goal of capturing the
underlying latent structure of the data and possibly reconstructing missing
values (i.e., tensor completion). We focus on one of the most well-known tensor
factorizations that captures multi-linear structure, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP). In
the presence of missing data, CP can be formulated as a weighted least squares
problem that models only the known entries. We develop an algorithm called
CP-WOPT (CP Weighted OPTimization) that uses a first-order optimization
approach to solve the weighted least squares problem. Based on extensive
numerical experiments, our algorithm is shown to successfully factorize tensors
with noise and up to 99% missing data. A unique aspect of our approach is that
it scales to sparse large-scale data, e.g., 1000 x 1000 x 1000 with five
million known entries (0.5% dense). We further demonstrate the usefulness of
CP-WOPT on two real-world applications: a novel EEG (electroencephalogram)
application where missing data is frequently encountered due to disconnections
of electrodes and the problem of modeling computer network traffic where data
may be absent due to the expense of the data collection process.

ranging from citation and friendship networks to food webs and gene regulatory
networks. Most of the existing community detection methods focus on
partitioning the entire network into communities, with the expectation of many
ties within communities and few ties between. However, many networks contain
nodes that do not fit in with any of the communities, and forcing every node
into a community can distort results. Here we propose a new framework that
focuses on community extraction instead of partition, extracting one community
at a time. The main idea behind extraction is that the strength of a community
should not depend on ties between members of other communities, but only on
ties within that community and its ties to the outside world. We show that the
new extraction criterion performs well on simulated and real networks, and
establish asymptotic consistency of our method under the block model
assumption.

time T+1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out
even further in time, i.e., links at time T+2, T+3, etc.? In this paper, we
consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix- and

method for collapsing multi-year data into a single matrix. We show how the
well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs
and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value

illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure

that both matrix- and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link
prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we
show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data

attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real
networks. We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical
properties of communities in large information, communication, technological,
biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of
networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in
several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as
``fingerprints'' of specific network categories. While community size
distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly
of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path
lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size,
but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a
characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within
communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community
embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their
communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category. Our findings
are verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection
methods.

behavior-aware protocols, services and architectures, there is a pressing need
to understand and realistically model mobile users behavioral characteristics,
their similarity and clustering. Such models are essential for the analysis,
performance evaluation, and simulation of future DTNs. This paper addresses
issues related to mobile user similarity, its definition, analysis and
modeling. To define similarity, we adopt a behavioral-profile based on users
location preferences using their on-line association matrix and its SVD, then
calculate the behavioral distance to capture user similarity. This measures the
difference of the major spatio-temporal behavioral trends and can be used to
cluster users into similarity groups or communities. We then analyze and
contrast similarity distributions of mobile user populations in two settings:
(i) based on real measurements from four major campuses with over ten thousand
users for a month, and (ii) based on existing mobility models, including random
direction and time-varying community models. Our results show a rich set of
similar communities in real mobile societies with distinct behavioral clusters
of users. This is true for all the traces studied, with the trend being
consistent over time. Surprisingly, however, we find that the existing mobility
models do not explicitly capture similarity and result in homogeneous users
that are all similar to each other. Thus the richness and diversity of user
behavioral patterns is not captured to any degree in the existing models. These
findings strongly suggest that similarity should be explicitly captured in
future mobility models, which motivates the need to re-visit mobility modeling
in the future.

profile similarity and link creation in the social network, with a focus on
triangle closure. We report a reciprocal causal connection: profile similarity
of users drives the subsequent closure in the social network and, reciprocally,
closure in the social network induces subsequent profile alignment. Access to
the dynamics of the social network also allows us to measure quantitative
indicators of preferential linking.

endeavour that encompasses myriad disciplines in the natural, social, and
information sciences. Here we introduce a framework for constructing taxonomies
of networks based on their structural similarities. These networks can arise
from any of numerous sources: they can be empirical or synthetic, they can
arise from multiple realizations of a single process, empirical or synthetic,
or they can represent entirely different systems in different disciplines.
Since the mesoscopic properties of networks are hypothesized to be important
for network function, we base our comparisons on summaries of network community
structures. While we use a specific method for uncovering network communities,
much of the introduced framework is independent of that choice. After
introducing the framework, we apply it to construct a taxonomy for 746
individual networks and demonstrate that our approach usefully identifies
similar networks. We also construct taxonomies within individual categories of
networks, and in each case we expose non-trivial structure. For example we
create taxonomies for similarity networks constructed from both political
voting data and financial data. We also construct network taxonomies to compare
the social structures of 100 Facebook networks and the growth structures
produced by different types of fungi.

Thus, preserving privacy without revealing sensitive information in the social

  service providers and curious buddies","  A major feature of the emerging geo-social networks is the ability to notify
a user when one of his friends (also called buddies) happens to be
geographically in proximity with the user. This proximity service is usually
offered by the network itself or by a third party service provider (SP) using
location data acquired from the users. This paper provides a rigorous
theoretical and experimental analysis of the existing solutions for the
location privacy problem in proximity services. This is a serious problem for
users who do not trust the SP to handle their location data, and would only
like to release their location information in a generalized form to
participating buddies. The paper presents two new protocols providing complete
privacy with respect to the SP, and controllable privacy with respect to the
buddies. The analytical and experimental analysis of the protocols takes into
account privacy, service precision, and computation and communication costs,
showing the superiority of the new protocols compared to those appeared in the
literature to date. The proposed protocols have also been tested in a full
system implementation of the proximity service.

network elements is determined by the the network structure is the topic of our
work. We map the structure of signal flow in directed networks by analysing the
degree of edge convergence and the overlap between the in- and output sets of
an edge. Definitions of convergence degree and overlap are based on the
shortest paths, thus they encapsulate global network properties. Using the
defining notions of convergence degree and overlapping set we clarify the
meaning of network causality and demonstrate the crucial role of chordless
circles. In real-world networks the flow representation distinguishes nodes
according to their signal transmitting, processing and control properties. The
analysis of real-world networks in terms of flow representation was in
accordance with the known functional properties of the network nodes. It is
shown that nodes with different signal processing, transmitting and control
properties are randomly connected at the global scale, while local connectivity
patterns depart from randomness. Grouping network nodes according to their
signal flow properties was unrelated to the network's community structure. We
present evidence that signal flow properties of small-world-like, real-world
networks can not be reconstructed by algorithms used to generate small-world
networks. Convergence degree values were calculated for regular oriented trees,
and its probability density function for networks grown with the preferential
attachment mechanism. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs we calculated both the
probability density function of convergence degrees and of overlaps.

individuals are linked through social interactions, which today are
increasingly mediated electronically by modern Information Communication
Technology thus leaving \"footprints\" of human behaviour as digital records. For
these datasets the network theory approach is a natural one as we have
demonstrated by analysing the dataset of multi-million user mobile phone

showing communities where individuals are connected with stronger ties and
between communities with weaker ties. Also the network topology and the
weighted links for pairs of individuals turned out to be related.These
empirical findings inspired us to take the next step in network theory, by
developing a simple network model based on basic network sociology mechanisms
to get friends in order to catch some salient features of mesoscopic community
and macroscopic topology formation. Our model turned out to produce many
empirically observed features of large-scale social networks. Thus we believe
that the network theory approach combining data analysis with modeling and

path in the presence of random proportional growth, stochastic birth and death

User-Centric Service (UCS) creation is expected to explode following a similar
success path to User-Generated Content. One of the major challenges in this
emerging highly user-centric networking paradigm is how to make these exploding
in numbers yet, individually, of vanishing demand services available in a
cost-effective manner. Of prime importance to the latter (and focus of this
paper) is the determination of the optimal location for hosting a UCS. Taking
into account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as
a facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable
heuristic solution to it.
  Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on
Complex Network Analysis. Given a current location of UCS, this metric helps to
a) identify a small subgraph of nodes with high capacity to act as service
demand concentrators; b) project on them a reduced yet accurate view of the
global demand distribution that preserves the key attraction forces on UCS;
and, ultimately, c) pave the service migration path towards its optimal
location in the network. The proposed iterative UCS migration algorithm, called
cDSMA, is extensively evaluated over synthetic and real-world network
topologies. Our results show that cDSMA achieves high accuracy, fast
convergence, remarkable insensitivity to the size and diameter of the network
and resilience to inaccurate estimates of demands for UCS across the network.
It is also shown to clearly outperform local-search heuristics for service
migration that constrain the subgraph to the immediate neighbourhood of the
node currently hosting UCS.

bloggers begin to write blogs with great interest, and then their interests
gradually achieve a balance with the passage of time. In order to describe the
phenomenon that people's interest in something gradually decreases until it
reaches a balance, we first propose the model that describes the attenuation of
interest and reflects the fact that people's interest becomes more stable after
a long time. We give a rigorous analysis on this model by non-homogeneous
Poisson processes. Our analysis indicates that the interval distribution of
arrival-time is a mixed distribution with exponential and power-law feature,
that is, it is a power law with an exponential cutoff. Second, we collect blogs
in ScienceNet.cn and carry on empirical studies on the interarrival time
distribution. The empirical results agree well with the analytical result,
obeying a special power law with the exponential cutoff, that is, a special
kind of Gamma distribution. These empirical results verify the model, providing
an evidence for a new class of phenomena in human dynamics. In human dynamics
there are other distributions, besides power-law distributions. These findings
demonstrate the variety of human behavior dynamics.

  Community-Changing Resolution Levels","  An algorithm for the detection of overlapping natural communities in networks
was proposed by Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Kertesz (LFK) last year. The LFK
algorithm constructs natural communities of (in principle) all nodes of a graph
by maximising the local fitness of communities. The resulting modules can
overlap. The generation of communities can easily be repeated for many values
of resolution; thus allowing different views on the network at different
resolutions. We implemented the main idea of the LFK algorithm---to generate
natural communities of each node of a network---in a different way. We start
with a value of the resolution parameter that is high enough for each node to
be its own natural community. As soon as the resolution is reduced, each node
acquires other nodes as members of its community, i.e. natural communities
grow. For each community found at a certain resolution level we calculate the
next lower resolution where a node is added. After adding a node to a community
of a seed node we check whether it is also the natural community of a node that
we have already analysed. In this case, we can stop expanding the seed node's
community. We tested our algorithm on a small benchmark graph and on a network
of about 500 papers in information science (weighted with the Salton index of
bibliographic coupling). In our tests, this approach results in characteristic
ranges of resolution where a large resolution change does not lead to a growth
of the natural community. Such stable modules were also obtained by applying
the LFK algorithm but since we determine communities for all resolution values
in one run, our approach is faster than the LFK reference. And our algorithm
reveals the hierarchical structure of the graph more easily.

number of alters as well as the deviation from a central value. This is
considered with three potential methods for naming one's friends: a strict

of two effects is present in the estimation of these effects: either that the
size of the effect is inflated in magnitude, or that the estimators instead are
centered about zero rather than related to the true effect. The degree of
heterogeneity in friend count is one of the major factors into whether such an

three orthogonal dimensions - the number of seed nodes activated at the
beginning (known as budget), the expected number of activated nodes at the end
of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage), and the time taken
for the propagation. We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize
the third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left
time unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as
Influence Maximization.
  In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally
motivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the
first problem, termed Minimum Target Set Selection (or MINTSS for short), a
coverage threshold n is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set
such that by activating it, at least n nodes are eventually activated in the
expected sense. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, a coverage threshold n
and a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size
at most k such that by activating it, at least n nodes are activated, in the
minimum possible time. Both these problems are NP-hard, which motivates our
interest in their approximation.
  For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a
bicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result
suggesting that improving it is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that
even bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several
conditions. However, if we allow the budget to be boosted by a logarithmic
factor and allow the coverage to fall short, then the problem can be solved
exactly in PTIME.
  Finally, we show the value of the approximation algorithms, by comparing them
against various heuristics.

  on a Blog Network","  We explore the hypothesis that it is possible to obtain information about the
dynamics of a blog network by analysing the temporal relationships between
blogs at a semantic level, and that this type of analysis adds to the knowledge
that can be extracted by studying the network only at the structural level of
URL links. We present an algorithm to automatically detect fine-grained
discussion topics, characterized by n-grams and time intervals. We then propose
a probabilistic model to estimate the temporal relationships that blogs have
with one another. We define the precursor score of blog A in relation to blog B
as the probability that A enters a new topic before B, discounting the effect
created by asymmetric posting rates. Network-level metrics of precursor and
laggard behavior are derived from these dyadic precursor score estimations.
This model is used to analyze a network of French political blogs. The scores
are compared to traditional link degree metrics. We obtain insights into the
dynamics of topic participation on this network, as well as the relationship
between precursor/laggard and linking behaviors. We validate and analyze
results with the help of an expert on the French blogosphere. Finally, we
propose possible applications to the improvement of search engine ranking
algorithms.

preferences and strategic analysis, we consider an early market model studied
in the field of economic theory, in which each trader's utility may be
influenced by the bundles of goods obtained by her social neighbors. The goal
of this paper is to understand and characterize the impact of social influence
on the complexity of computing and approximating market equilibria.
  We present complexity-theoretic and algorithmic results for approximating
market equilibria in this model with focus on two concrete influence models
based on the traditional linear utility functions. Recall that an Arrow-Debreu
market equilibrium in a conventional exchange market with linear utility
functions can be computed in polynomial time by convex programming. Our
complexity results show that even a bounded-degree, planar influence network
can significantly increase the difficulty of equilibrium computation even in
markets with only a constant number of goods. Our algorithmic results suggest
that finding an approximate equilibrium in markets with hierarchical influence
networks might be easier than that in markets with arbitrary neighborhood
structures. By demonstrating a simple market with a constant number of goods
and a bounded-degree, planar influence graph whose equilibrium is PPAD-hard to
approximate, we also provide a counterexample to a common belief, which we
refer to as the myth of a constant number of goods, that equilibria in markets
with a constant number of goods are easy to compute or easy to approximate.

find that people interested in some subjects gradually disappear and the
interval distribution is a power law. According to this feature, we propose a
model with gradually decaying interest. We give a rigorous analysis on the

the interval distribution. Our analysis indicates that the time interval
between two consecutive events follows the power-law distribution with a
tunable exponent, which can be controlled by the model parameters and is in
interval (1,+{\infty}). The analytical result agrees with the empirical results
well, obeying an approximately power-law form. Our model provides a theoretical
basis for human behaviour dynamics of comments on Blog posts.

of multiple and interdependent components. Among all studies on complex
networks, topological structure analysis is of the most fundamental importance,
as it represents a natural route to understand the dynamics, as well as to
synthesize or optimize the functions, of networks. A broad spectrum of network
structural patterns have been respectively reported in the past decade, such as
communities, multipartites, hubs, authorities, outliers, bow ties, and others.
Here, we show that most individual real-world networks demonstrate multiplex
structures. That is, a multitude of known or even unknown (hidden) patterns can
simultaneously situate in the same network, and moreover they may be overlapped
and nested with each other to collaboratively form a heterogeneous, nested or
hierarchical organization, in which different connective phenomena can be
observed at different granular levels. In addition, we show that the multiplex
structures hidden in exploratory networks can be well defined as well as
effectively recognized within an unified framework consisting of a set of
proposed concepts, models, and algorithms. Our findings provide a strong
evidence that most real-world complex systems are driven by a combination of
heterogeneous mechanisms that may collaboratively shape their ubiquitous
multiplex structures as we observe currently. This work also contributes a
mathematical tool for analyzing different sources of networks from a new
perspective of unveiling multiplex structures, which will be beneficial to
multiple disciplines including sociology, economics and computer science.

and interactions. Like other entities that are reproduced and evolve, words
rise or decline depending upon a complex interplay between {their intrinsic
properties and the environments in which they function}. Using Internet
discussion communities as model systems, we define the concept of a word niche
as the relationship between the word and the characteristic features of the
environments in which it is used. We develop a method to quantify two important
aspects of the size of the word niche: the range of individuals using the word
and the range of topics it is used to discuss. Controlling for word frequency,
we show that these aspects of the word niche are strong determinants of changes
in word frequency. Previous studies have already indicated that word frequency
itself is a correlate of word success at historical time scales. Our analysis
of changes in word frequencies over time reveals that the relative sizes of
word niches are far more important than word frequencies in the dynamics of the
entire vocabulary at shorter time scales, as the language adapts to new
concepts and social groupings. We also distinguish endogenous versus exogenous
factors as additional contributors to the fates of words, and demonstrate the
force of this distinction in the rise of novel words. Our results indicate that
short-term nonstationarity in word statistics is strongly driven by individual
proclivities, including inclinations to provide novel information and to
project a distinctive social identity.

way of maintaining their competitiveness. Consequently, they cannot rely solely
on themselves, but must cooperate by combining their advantages. To obtain the
actual condition for this cooperation, a multi-layered network based on two
different types of data was investigated. The first type was transaction data
from Japanese firms. The network created from the data included 961,363 firms
and 7,808,760 links. The second type of data were from joint-patent
applications in Japan. The joint-patent application network included 54,197
nodes and 154,205 links. These two networks were merged into one network.
  The first anaysis was based on input-output tables and three different tables
were compared. The correlation coefficients between tables revealed that
transactions were more strongly tied to joint-patent applications than the
total amount of money. The total amount of money and transactions have few
relationships and these are probably connected to joint-patent applications in
different mechanisms. The second analysis was conducted based on the p* model.
Choice, multiplicity, reciprocity, multi-reciprocity and transitivity
configurations were evaluated. Multiplicity and reciprocity configurations were
significant in all the analyzed industries. The results for multiplicity meant
that transactions and joint-patent application links were closely related.
Multi-reciprocity and transitivity configurations were significant in some of
the analyzed industries. It was difficult to find any common characteristics in
the industries. Bayesian networks were used in the third analysis. The learned
structure revealed that if a transaction link between two firms is known, the
categories of firms' industries do not affect to the existence of a patent
link.

interest groups, school classes and small companies. These groups play the role
of nodes, and individuals are represented by links between these nodes. The

challenged by individual self-interests. While game theory has studied this
problem extensively, there is little work on interactions within and across

behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as
non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another.
  To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within

populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to
different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other
factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For
example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two
interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly
punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does
cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even
revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements
between groups with conflicting interests?

However, the comparison between these spectral methods is less reported. More
importantly, it is still unclear which matrix is more appropriate for the

evaluating the effectiveness of these five matrices against the benchmark

Test results demonstrate that the normalized Laplacian matrix and the

identifying the community structure of networks. This indicates that it is
crucial to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of node degree when
using spectral analysis for the detection of community structure. In addition,
to our surprise, the modularity matrix exhibits very similar performance to the

desired benefits from using the configuration model as reference network with

between the network entities. However, many real networks can only be correctly
described using two different types of relations. Connectivity links that
enable the nodes to function cooperatively as a network and dependency links
that bind the failure of one network element to the failure of other network
elements. Here we present for the first time an analytical framework for
studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and
dependency links. We show that the synergy between the two types of failures
leads to an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating
effect on the network stability and completely alters the known assumptions
regarding the robustness of networks. We present exact analytical results for
the dramatic change in the network behavior when introducing dependency links.
For a high density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a form of a
first order phase transition while for a low density of dependency links the
network disintegrates in a second order transition. Moreover, opposed to
networks containing only connectivity links where a broader degree distribution
results in a more robust network, when both types of links are present a broad
degree distribution leads to higher vulnerability.

  Partitioning","  The number of triangles is a computationally expensive graph statistic which
is frequently used in complex network analysis (e.g., transitivity ratio), in
various random graph models (e.g., exponential random graph model) and in
important real world applications such as spam detection, uncovering of the
hidden thematic structure of the Web and link recommendation. Counting
triangles in graphs with millions and billions of edges requires algorithms
which run fast, use small amount of space, provide accurate estimates of the
number of triangles and preferably are parallelizable.
  In this paper we present an efficient triangle counting algorithm which can
be adapted to the semistreaming model. The key idea of our algorithm is to
combine the sampling algorithm of Tsourakakis et al. and the partitioning of
the set of vertices into a high degree and a low degree subset respectively as
in the Alon, Yuster and Zwick work treating each set appropriately. We obtain a
running time $O \left(m + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t \epsilon^2} \right)$
and an $\epsilon$ approximation (multiplicative error), where $n$ is the number
of vertices, $m$ the number of edges and $\Delta$ the maximum number of
triangles an edge is contained.
  Furthermore, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to the semistreaming
model with space usage $O\left(m^{1/2}\log{n} + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t
\epsilon^2} \right)$ and a constant number of passes (three) over the graph
stream. We apply our methods in various networks with several millions of edges
and we obtain excellent results. Finally, we propose a random projection based
method for triangle counting and provide a sufficient condition to obtain an
estimate with low variance.

dominance in biological systems. Here we consider this game in the social
context of competition between opinions in a networked society. In our model,
every agent has an opinion which is drawn from the three choices: rock, paper
or scissors. In every timestep a link is selected randomly and the game is
played between the nodes connected by the link. The loser either adopts the
opinion of the winner or rewires the link. These rules define an adaptive
network on which the agent's opinions coevolve with the network topology of
social contacts. We show analytically and numerically that nonequilibrium phase
transitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength. The transitions
separate four distinct phases which differ in the observed dynamics of opinions
and topology. In particular, there is one phase where the population settles to
an arbitrary consensus opinion. We present a detailed analysis of the
corresponding transitions revealing an apparently paradoxial behavior. The
system approaches consensus states where they are unstable, whereas other
dynamics prevail when the consensus states are stable.

  Social Networks","  Recent years have witnessed the explosion of online social networks (OSNs).
They provide powerful IT-innovations for online social activities such as
organizing contacts, publishing contents, and sharing interests between friends
who may never meet before. As more and more people become the active users of
online social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed
improve our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social
spectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs?
Our work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this
end, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social
networks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best
knowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the
existence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach
this, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis
for extensive real-world OSNs. Second, we divide OSNs users into two
categories: rational and aggressive, and find that rational users intend to
develop close and reciprocated relationships, whereas aggressive users have no
consistent behaviors. Third, we build a simple model to capture the constraints
of time and cognition that affect the evolution of online social networks.
Finally, we show the potential use of our findings in viral marketing and
privacy management in online social networks.

with important practical consequences for Life. An approach that has gathered
momentum since the late 1990's, looks at protein hetero-polymers and their
folding process through the lens of complex network analysis. Consequently,
there is now a body of empirical studies describing topological characteristics
of protein macro-molecules through their contact networks and linking these
topological characteristics to protein folding. The present paper is primarily
a review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by
emphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional
places where \"power-laws\" may be lurking within protein contact networks.
Further, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks. This
closer scrutiny of protein contact networks raises new questions for further
research, and identifies new regularities which may be useful to parameterize a
network approach to protein folding. Preliminary experiments with such a model
confirm that the regularities we identified cannot be easily reproduced through
random effects. Indeed, the grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate
the process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage
patterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior
of proteins as they fold. Keywords: network analysis, protein contact networks,

The whole area of all users is divided into clusters recursively in order to
get the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR). The exact location information of a
user is replaced by his MBR. Privacy analysis shows that our approach can
achieve high resilience to location privacy threats and provide more privacy

strong robustness.

dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods
have been developed separately to identify community structure in different
classes of networks, such as unipartite networks, bipartite networks, and
directed networks. We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be
represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely
consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure
on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the
bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA),
which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection.
The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we
make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a
locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci
mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the
current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment
technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from
the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation
rule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of
the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process.
Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms
of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.

empirically and present an efficient and scalable mathematical framework for
quantitative analysis of cascades on networks. We define a cascade generating
function that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades.
We show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic
properties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths,
and average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade
generating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing
information within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately
reconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics
on the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories,
and easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on
Digg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than
3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties.
We identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining,
branching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story
through the Digg social network. Our computational framework is general and
offers a practical solution to quantitative analysis of the microscopic
structure of even very large cascades.

  Structural Information","  The eigenvalues of matrices representing the structure of large-scale complex
networks present a wide range of applications, from the analysis of dynamical
processes taking place in the network to spectral techniques aiming to rank the
importance of nodes in the network. A common approach to study the relationship
between the structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic
random networks in which structural properties of interest, such as degree
distributions, are prescribed. Although very common, synthetic models present
two major flaws: (\emph{i}) These models are only suitable to study a very
limited range of structural properties, and (\emph{ii}) they implicitly induce
structural properties that are not directly controlled and can deceivingly
influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based
on synthetic models, instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex
optimization to study how structural properties influence the spectrum of
eigenvalues of the network. Using our approach, we can compute with low

  and Demand: Theory and Sensitivity Analysis","  We propose new probabilistic models for the spatial distribution of supply
and demand and use the models to determine how the trip length distribution is
affected by the relative shortage or excess of supply, the spatial clustering
of supply and demand, and the degree of attraction or repulsion between supply
and demand at different spatial scales. The models have a multiplicative
structure and in certain cases possess scale invariance properties. Using
detailed population data in metropolitan US regions validates the demand model.
The trip length distribution, evaluated under destination choice models of the
intervening opportunities type, has quasi-analytic form.We take advantage of
this feature to study the sensitivity of the trip length distribution to
parameters of the demand, supply and destination choice models. We find that
trip length is affected in important but different ways by the spatial density
of potential destinations, the dependence among their attractiveness levels,
and the correlation between supply and demand at different spatial scales.

descriptor of ordered structures, departing from the definition of three
conditions to be satisfied for a hierarchical structure: {\em order}, {\em
predictability} and {\em pyramidal structure}. According to these principles we
define a hierarchical index taking concepts from graph and information theory.
This estimator allows to quantify the hierarchical character of any system
susceptible to be abstracted in a feedforward causal graph, i.e., a directed
acyclic graph defined in a single connected structure. Our hierarchical index
is a balance between this predictability and pyramidal condition by the
definition of two entropies: one attending the onward flow and other for the
backward reversion. We show how this index allows to identify hierarchical,
anti-hierarchical and non hierarchical structures. Our formalism reveals that
departing from the defined conditions for a hierarchical structure, feedforward
trees and the inverted tree graphs emerge as the only causal structures of
maximal hierarchical and anti-hierarchical systems, respectively. Conversely,
null values of the hierarchical index are attributed to a number of different
configuration networks; from linear chains, due to their lack of pyramid
structure, to full-connected feedforward graphs where the diversity of onward
pathways is canceled by the uncertainty (lack of predictability) when going
backwards. Some illustrative examples are provided for the distinction among
these three types of hierarchical causal graphs.

interval between interactions for a pair of individuals and for an individual
often follows a long-tail distribution. We investigate the effect of such a
non-Poissonian nature of human behavior on dynamics of opinion formation. We
use a variant of the voter model and numerically compare the time to consensus
of all the voters with different distributions of interevent intervals and
different networks. Compared with the exponential distribution of interevent
intervals (i.e., the standard voter model), the power-law distribution of
interevent intervals slows down consensus on the ring. This is because of the
memory effect; in the power-law case, the expected time until the next update
event on a link is large if the link has not had an update event for a long
time. On the complete graph, the consensus time in the power-law case is close
to that in the exponential case. Regular graphs bridge these two results such
that the slowing down of the consensus in the power-law case as compared to the
exponential case is less pronounced as the degree increases.

social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of these
networks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changes
over time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lag
behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism.
Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic
studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific
properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for
studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing
snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of
reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency
with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through
latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing
the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly
intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this
analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting)
between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the
temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph
properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation
called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some
other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal
domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet
in single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs.

simultaneously reveals their hierarchy. Using a local fitness function, the
algorithm greedily expands natural communities of seeds until the whole graph
is covered. The hierarchy of communities is obtained analytically by
calculating resolution levels at which communities grow rather than numerically
by testing different resolution levels. This analytic procedure is not only
more exact than its numerical alternatives such as LFM and GCE but also much
faster. Critical resolution levels can be identified by searching for intervals
in which large changes of the resolution do not lead to growth of communities.
We tested our algorithm on benchmark graphs and on a network of 492 papers in
information science. Combined with a specific post-processing, the algorithm
gives much more precise results on LFR benchmarks with high overlap compared to
other algorithms and performs very similar to GCE.

investigate the properties of trust propagation on networks, based on a simple
metric of trust transitivity. We investigate analytically the percolation
properties of trust transitivity in random networks with arbitrary degree
distribution, and compare with numerical realizations. We find that the
existence of a non-zero fraction of absolute trust (i.e. entirely confident
trust) is a requirement for the viability of global trust propagation in large
systems: The average pair-wise trust is marked by a discontinuous transition at
a specific fraction of absolute trust, below which it vanishes. Furthermore, we
perform an extensive analysis of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust, in
view of the concepts introduced. We compare different scenarios of trust
distribution: community- and authority-centered. We find that these scenarios
lead to sharply different patterns of trust propagation, due to the segregation
of authority hubs and densely-connected communities. While the
authority-centered scenario is more efficient, and leads to higher average
trust values, it favours weakly-connected \"fringe\" nodes, which are directly
trusted by authorities. The community-centered scheme, on the other hand,
favours nodes with intermediate degrees, in detriment of the authorities and
its \"fringe\" peers.

recently. In this paper, the fractal characteristic of human behaviors is
investigated from the perspective of time series constructed with the amount of
library loans. The Hurst exponents and length of non-periodic cycles calculated
through Rescaled Range Analysis indicate that the time series of human
behaviors is fractal with long-range correlation. Then the time series are
converted to complex networks by visibility graph algorithm. The topological
properties of the networks, such as scale-free property, small-world effect and
hierarchical structure imply that close relationships exist between the amounts
of repetitious actions performed by people during certain periods of time,
especially for some important days. Finally, the networks obtained are verified
to be not fractal and self-similar using box-counting method. Our work implies
the intrinsic regularity shown in human collective repetitious behaviors.

  Model Implementation of the Canadian Traveller Problem","  The deployment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) along major roadways
has been a favoured strategy of insurgents in recent war zones, both for the
ability to cause damage to targets along roadways at minimal cost, but also as
a means of controlling the flow of traffic and causing additional expense to
opposing forces. Among other related approaches (which we discuss), the
adversarial problem has an analogue in the Canadian Traveller Problem, wherein
a stretch of road is blocked with some independent probability, and the state
of the road is only discovered once the traveller reaches one of the
intersections that bound this stretch of road. We discuss the implementation of
ideas from social network analysis, namely the notion of \"betweenness
centrality\", and how this can be adapted to the notion of deployment of IEDs
with the aid of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): namely, how we can model the
probability of an IED deployment in terms of the increased effort due to
Canadian betweenness, how we can include expert judgement on the probability of
a deployment, and how we can extend the approach to estimation and updating
over several time steps.

the \"social part\" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at
identifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions
among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific
communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time
communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as
representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists'
works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social
objects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the
patterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of
the arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics.
As a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a
work in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between
co-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most
proficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how
these patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a
selection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of
individuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order
to advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and
scientists working on them. The dataset is analyzed a) at a global level, e.g.
the network evolution, b) at the meso-level, e.g. communities emergence, and c)

classical model, in each round each informed node informs a random neighbor. In
the recently proposed quasirandom variant, each node has a (cyclic) list of its
neighbors. Once informed, it starts at a random position of the list, but from
then on informs its neighbors in the order of the list. While for sparse random

quasirandom model generally is faster, but also that the runtime is more
concentrated around the mean. This is surprising given that much fewer random

a lossy communication model, where each transmission does not reach its target

one of the dominating contributors to HIV prevalence in industrialized
countries. In Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, the MSM risk group has
been traced for decades. This has motivated studies which provide detailed
information about MSM's risk behavior statistically, psychologically and
sociologically. Despite the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence
of HIV among MSM increases. In the long term the contradictory effects of risk
behavior and effective therapy are still poorly understood. Using a previously
presented Complex Agent Network model, we describe steady and casual
partnerships to predict the HIV spreading among MSM. Behavior-related
parameters and values, inferred from studies on Amsterdam MSM, are fed into the

Subsequently, we study scenarios to assess the contradictory effects of risk
behavior and effective therapy, by varying corresponding values of parameters.
Finally, we conduct quantitative analysis based on the resulting incidence
data. The simulated incidence reproduces the ACS historical incidence well and
helps to predict the HIV epidemic among MSM in Amsterdam. Our results show that
in the long run the positive influence of effective therapy can be outweighed
by an increase in risk behavior of at least 30% for MSM. Conclusion: We
recommend, based on the model predictions, that lowering risk behavior is the
prominent control mechanism of HIV incidence even in the presence of effective

proliferation of emerging online social communities, such as online communities
formed through social networking services. Providing incentives for cooperation
in social communities is particularly challenging because of their unique
features: a large population of anonymous agents interacting infrequently,
having asymmetric interests, and dynamically joining and leaving the community;
operation errors; and low-cost reputation whitewashing. In this paper, taking
these features into consideration, we propose a framework for the design and
analysis of a class of incentive schemes based on a social norm, which consists
of a reputation scheme and a social strategy. We first define the concept of a
sustainable social norm under which every agent has an incentive to follow the
social strategy given the reputation scheme. We then formulate the problem of
designing an optimal social norm, which selects a social norm that maximizes
overall social welfare among all sustainable social norms. Using the proposed
framework, we study the structure of optimal social norms and the impacts of
punishment lengths and whitewashing on optimal social norms. Our results show
that optimal social norms are capable of sustaining cooperation, with the
amount of cooperation varying depending on the community characteristics.

the part of a message, and virality, defined as the probability that it be sent
along, is of significant theoretical and practical importance, e.g. for viral
marketing. A quantitative study of emailing of articles from the NY Times finds
a strong link between positive affect and virality, and, based on psychological
theories it is concluded that this relation is universally valid. The
conclusion appears to be in contrast with classic theory of diffusion in news
media emphasizing negative affect as promoting propagation. In this paper we
explore the apparent paradox in a quantitative analysis of information
diffusion on Twitter. Twitter is interesting in this context as it has been
shown to present both the characteristics social and news media. The basic
measure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet. Twitter is
different from email in that retweeting does not depend on pre-existing social
relations, but often occur among strangers, thus in this respect Twitter may be
more similar to traditional news media. We therefore hypothesize that negative
news content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive
sentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A
complete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of
tweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train
a classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news
information. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in
the news segment, but not in the non-news segment. We conclude that the
relation between affect and virality is more complex than expected based on the
findings of Berger and Milkman (2010), in short 'if you want to be cited: Sweet
talk your friends or serve bad news to the public'.

be divided between linear and nonlinear versions. Linear models, including the
BA model (Brabasi and Albert, 1999), assume that the average activity of users
is a constant independent of population. Hence the total activity is a linear
function of population. On the contrary, nonlinear models suggest that the
average activity is affected by the size of the population and the total
activity is a nonlinear function of population. In the current study,
supporting evidences for the nonlinear growth assumption are obtained from data
on Internet users' tagging behavior. A power law relationship between the
number of new tags (F) and the population (P), which can be expressed as F ~ P

show that the multiplicity distribution of real networks is in many cases

Malkhi in 2006 motivated by applications in social networking. Initially there
are n agents wishing to coalesce into one cluster via a decentralized
stochastic process, where each round is as follows: every cluster flips a fair
coin to dictate whether it is to issue or accept requests in this round.
Issuing a request amounts to contacting a cluster randomly chosen
proportionally to its size. A cluster accepting requests is to select an
incoming one uniformly (if there are such) and merge with that cluster.
Empirical results by Fernandess and Malkhi suggested the protocol concludes in
O(log n) rounds with high probability, whereas numerical estimates by Oded
Schramm, based on an ingenious analytic approximation, suggested that the
coalescence time should be super-logarithmic. Our contribution is a rigorous
study of the stochastic coalescence process with two consequences. First, we
confirm that the above process indeed requires super-logarithmic time w.h.p.,
where the inefficient rounds are due to oversized clusters that occasionally
develop. Second, we remedy this by showing that a simple modification produces
an essentially optimal distributed protocol; if clusters favor their smallest
incoming merge request then the process does terminate in O(log n) rounds
w.h.p., and simulations show that the new protocol readily outperforms the
original one. Our upper bound hinges on a potential function involving the
logarithm of the number of clusters and the cluster-susceptibility, carefully
chosen to form a supermartingale. The analysis of the lower bound builds upon
the novel approach of Schramm which may find additional applications: rather
than seeking a single parameter that controls the system behavior, instead one

stochastic routing inspired by a zero-range process known in statistical
physics. By parameters $\alpha$ and $\delta$, this model controls
degree-dependent hopping of packets and forwarding of packets with higher
performance at more busy nodes. Through a theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations, we derive the condition for the concentration of packets at a few
hubs. In particular, we show that the optimal $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are
involved in the trade-off between a detour path for $\alpha < 0$ and long wait
at hubs for $\alpha > 0$; In the low-performance regime at a small $\delta$,
the wandering path for $\alpha < 0$ better reduces the mean travel time of a
packet with high reachability. Although, in the high-performance regime at a
large $\delta$, the difference between $\alpha > 0$ and $\alpha < 0$ is small,
neither the wandering long path with short wait trapped at nodes ($\alpha =
-1$), nor the short hopping path with long wait trapped at hubs ($\alpha = 1$)
is advisable. A uniformly random walk ($\alpha = 0$) yields slightly better
performance. We also discuss the congestion phenomena in a more complicated
situation with packet generation at each time step.

sample. Our goal is to find a distribution minimizing the expected estimation
error against an adversarially chosen Lipschitz continuous function. Our work
falls into the broad class of estimating aggregate statistics of a function
from a small number of carefully chosen samples. The general problem has a wide
range of practical applications in areas as diverse as sensor networks, social

points lie on a line, the running time improves to an FPTAS. Both algorithms
are based on approximately solving a linear program with an infinite set of
constraints, by using an approximate separation oracle. For
Lipschitz-continuous functions over $[0,1]$, we calculate the precise

every non-informed agent which is within distance $R$ from $v$ ($R>0$ is the

this process much more complex than the (standard) flooding. We prove optimal

market shares in the product market. We estimate directly the average growth
rate of market shares and its standard deviation, the birth rates and the
\"death\" (hazard) rate of products. We find that temporal variations and product
differences of the observed power-law exponents can be fully captured by the
theory with no adjustable parameters. Our results can be generalized to many

information or resources can only flow through paths that follow the

processes. However, since networks have so far been usually considered static

Building on a definition and algorithmic implementation of the average temporal
distance between nodes, we study temporal paths in empirical networks of human
communication and air transport. Although temporal distances correlate with
static graph distances, there is a large spread, and nodes that appear close
from the static network view may be connected via slow paths or not at all.
Differences between static and temporal properties are further highlighted in
studies of the temporal closeness centrality. In addition, correlations and
heterogeneities in the underlying event sequences affect temporal path lengths,
increasing temporal distances in communication networks and decreasing them in
the air transport network.

time-varying graphs), which was initially developed to model and analyze
highly-dynamic and infrastructure-less communication networks such as mobile
ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, or vehicular networks. We discuss
its applicability to complex networks in general, and social networks in

dynamic phenomena in terms of temporal interactions, and allows to easily
switch the perspective between local and global dynamics. As an example, we
chose the case of scientific communities by analyzing portion of the ArXiv
repository (ten years of publications in physics) focusing on the social
determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind
the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that
scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through
co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists'
mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective
link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates,
select and refers to. In the paper we show the emergence/selection of a
community as a goal-driven preferential attachment toward a set of authors

by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by
exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive

of systems of interest should be treated, more appropriately, as interacting
networks or networks of networks. Here we introduce a novel graph-theoretical
framework for studying the interaction structure between subnetworks embedded
within a complex network of networks. This framework allows us to quantify the
structural role of single vertices or whole subnetworks with respect to the
interaction of a pair of subnetworks on local, mesoscopic and global

  Climate networks have recently been shown to be a powerful tool for the
analysis of climatological data. Applying the general framework for studying
interacting networks, we introduce coupled climate subnetworks to represent and
investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of
distinct climatological variables. Using coupled climate subnetworks to
investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height

analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with
other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets
of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence.
Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are
nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful
task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is
closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank
attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not
sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally
equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the
necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can
we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first
problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role
similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic
equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second
problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative
computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the
axiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which can
guarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-defined
threshold $\theta$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstrate
the superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real

unknown Internet topologies. Its main advantage over random walks and other
exploration techniques is that a BFS sample is a plausible graph on its own,
and therefore we can study its topological characteristics. However, it has
been empirically observed that incomplete BFS is biased toward high-degree
nodes, which may strongly affect the measurements. In this paper, we first
analytically quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we
calculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a
function of the fraction f of covered nodes, in a random graph RG(pk) with an
arbitrary degree distribution pk. We also show that, for RG(pk), all commonly
used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, Snowball Sampling, RDS)
suffer from exactly the same bias. Next, based on our theoretical analysis, we
propose a practical BFS-bias correction procedure. It takes as input a
collected BFS sample together with its fraction f. Even though RG(pk) does not
capture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as
assortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad
range of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut
networks. Finally, we consider and evaluate a family of alternative correction
procedures, and demonstrate that, although they are unbiased for an arbitrary
topology, their large variance makes them far less effective than the
RG(pk)-based technique.

Metrics based on the random walk have been used in many applications from image
processing to Web page ranking. However, how appropriate are random walks to
modeling and analyzing social networks? We argue that unlike a random walk,
which conserves the quantity diffusing on a network, many interesting social
phenomena, such as the spread of information or disease on a social network,
are fundamentally non-conservative. When an individual infects her neighbor
with a virus, the total amount of infection increases. We classify diffusion
processes as conservative and non-conservative and show how these differences
impact the choice of metrics used for network analysis, as well as our
understanding of network structure and behavior. We show that Alpha-Centrality,
which mathematically describes non-conservative diffusion, leads to new
insights into the behavior of spreading processes on networks. We give a
scalable approximate algorithm for computing the Alpha-Centrality in a massive
graph. We validate our approach on real-world online social networks of Digg.
We show that a non-conservative metric, such as Alpha-Centrality, produces
better agreement with empirical measure of influence than conservative metrics,
such as PageRank. We hope that our investigation will inspire further
exploration into the realms of conservative and non-conservative metrics in
social network analysis.

this paper, we analyze the stochastic Kronecker graph model (SKG), which is the
foundation of the Graph500 supercomputer benchmark due to its favorable
properties and easy parallelization. Our goal is to provide a deeper
understanding of the parameters and properties of this model so that its
functionality as a benchmark is increased. We develop a rigorous mathematical

a lognormal distribution. However, we formalize an enhanced version of the SKG
model that uses random noise for smoothing. We prove both in theory and in
practice that this enhancement leads to a lognormal distribution. Additionally,
we provide a precise analysis of isolated vertices, showing that the graphs
that are produced by SKG might be quite different than intended. For example,
between 50% and 75% of the vertices in the Graph500 benchmarks will be
isolated. Finally, we show that this model tends to produce extremely small
core numbers (compared to most social networks and other real graphs) for
common parameter choices.

preserve only part of the topology of an observed network are systematically

problematic. The existing approaches are either computationally demanding and
beyond analytic control, or analytically accessible but highly approximate.
Here we propose a solution to this long-standing problem by introducing an
exact and fast method that allows to obtain expectation values and standard
deviations of any topological property analytically, for any binary, weighted,
directed or undirected network. Remarkably, the time required to obtain the
expectation value of any property is as short as that required to compute the
same property on the single original network. Our method reveals that the null
behavior of various correlation properties is different from what previously
believed, and highly sensitive to the particular network considered. Moreover,
our approach shows that important structural properties (such as the modularity
used in community detection problems) are currently based on incorrect
expressions, and provides the exact quantities that should replace them.

with other aspects of social dynamics. In this work, after an analysis of
limitations of the Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) bounded confidence, relative
agreement model, we propose the Mixed model that takes into account two
psychological types of individuals. Concord agents (C-agents) are friendly
people; they interact in a way that their opinions get closer always. Agents of
the other psychological type show partial antagonism in their interaction
(PA-agents). Opinion dynamics in heterogeneous social groups, consisting of
agents of the two types, was studied on different social networks. Limit cases
of the mixed model, pure C- and PA-societies, were also studied. We found that
group opinion formation is, qualitatively, almost independent of the topology
of networks used in this work. Opinion fragmentation, polarization and
consensus are observed in the mixed model at different proportions of PA- and
C-agents, depending on the value of initial opinion tolerance of agents. As for
the opinion formation and arising of \"dissidents\", the opinion dynamics of the
C-agents society was found to be similar to that of the DW model, except for
the rate of opinion convergence. Nevertheless, mixed societies showed dynamics
and bifurcation patterns notably different to those of the DW model. The
influence of biased initial conditions over opinion formation in heterogeneous
social groups was also studied versus the initial value of opinion uncertainty,
varying the proportion of the PA- to C-agents. Bifurcation diagrams showed
impressive evolution of collective opinion, in particular, radical change of
left to right consensus or vice versa at an opinion uncertainty value equal to
0.7 in the model with the PA/C mixture of population near 50/50.

map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal
Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it
lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an
imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper
presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from
all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer
science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries
(DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at
journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of
sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of
journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and

conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science

  networks","  Materials in biology span all the scales from Angstroms to meters and
typically consist of complex hierarchical assemblies of simple building blocks.
Here we describe an application of category theory to describe structural and
resulting functional properties of biological protein materials by developing
so-called ologs. An olog is like a \"concept web\" or \"semantic network\" except
that it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.
This key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to
evolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We
consider simple cases of alpha-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments
subjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their
structural and resulting mechanical properties. We also construct a
representation of a social network in which people send text-messages to their
nearest neighbors and act as a team to perform a task. We show that the olog
for the protein and the olog for the social network feature identical
category-theoretic representations, and we proceed to precisely explicate the
analogy or isomorphism between them. The examples presented here demonstrate
that the intrinsic nature of a complex system, which in particular includes a
precise relationship between structure and function at different hierarchical
levels, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows for
comparative studies between disparate materials or fields of application, and
results in novel approaches to derive functionality in the design of de novo
hierarchical systems. We discuss opportunities and challenges associated with
the description of complex biological materials by using ologs as a powerful
tool for analysis and design in the context of materiomics, and we present the
potential impact of this approach for engineering, life sciences, and medicine.

stochastically her utility function composed from her own and the co-players'

performed in parallel on all nodes (synchronous model) or sequentially
(asynchronous model); both models present some drawback, e.g., algorithm
termination is nor granted in the first case, performances can be worst in the
second case. In this paper, we present a semi-synchronous version of LPA which
aims to combine the advantages of both synchronous and asynchronous models. We
prove that our models always converge to a stable labeling. Moreover, we
experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy comparing
its performance with the asynchronous model both in terms of quality,
efficiency and stability. Tests show that the proposed protocol does not harm
the quality of the partitioning. Moreover it is quite efficient; each
propagation step is extremely parallelizable and it is more stable than the
asynchronous model, thanks to the fact that only a small amount of
randomization is used by our proposal.

  Distribution","  One of the most influential recent results in network analysis is that many
natural networks exhibit a power-law or log-normal degree distribution. This
has inspired numerous generative models that match this property. However, more
recent work has shown that while these generative models do have the right
degree distribution, they are not good models for real life networks due to
their differences on other important metrics like conductance. We believe this
is, in part, because many of these real-world networks have very different
joint degree distributions, i.e. the probability that a randomly selected edge
will be between nodes of degree k and l. Assortativity is a sufficient
statistic of the joint degree distribution, and it has been previously noted
that social networks tend to be assortative, while biological and technological
networks tend to be disassortative.
  We suggest understanding the relationship between network structure and the
joint degree distribution of graphs is an interesting avenue of further
research. An important tool for such studies are algorithms that can generate
random instances of graphs with the same joint degree distribution. This is the
main topic of this paper and we study the problem from both a theoretical and
practical perspective. We provide an algorithm for constructing simple graphs
from a given joint degree distribution, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method
for sampling them. We also show that the state space of simple graphs with a
fixed degree distribution is connected via end point switches. We empirically
evaluate the mixing time of this Markov Chain by using experiments based on the
autocorrelation of each edge. These experiments show that our Markov Chain
mixes quickly on real graphs, allowing for utilization of our techniques in
practice.

New religions, new languages appear though others disappear. All religions and
languages evolve when they adapt to the society developments. On the other
hand, the number of adherents of a given religion, the number of persons
speaking a language is not fixed. Several questions can be raised. E.g. from a
macroscopic point of view : How many religions/languages exist at a given time?
What is their distribution? What is their life time? How do they evolve?. From
a microscopic view point: can one invent agent based models to describe
macroscopic aspects? Does it exist simple evolution equations? It is
intuitively accepted, but also found through from statistical analysis of the
frequency distribution that an attachment process is the primary cause of the
distribution evolution : usually the initial religion/language is that of the
mother. Later on, changes can occur either due to heterogeneous agent
interaction processes or due to external field constraints, - or both. Such
cases can be illustrated with historical facts and data. It is stressed that
characteristic time scales are different, and recalled that external fields are

that the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and
small-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component
in the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic
relationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the

critique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by

role of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis

network, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and
resilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a
top-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that
information about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a
moderately robust and resilient core network of blogs. We speculate that the
organization of V-day represents the very first case, in Italian history, of a
political demonstration developed and promoted primarily via the use of social
media on the web.

over short timescales can systematically reduce cultural heterogeneity in the
long run, and whether offline and online human interactions contribute
differently to the process. Theoretical models suggest that short-term
collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding,
since they require very different levels of social influence. The latter
jointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network
and the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space.
However, while the empirical properties of social networks are well understood,
little is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in
cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in
models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of
the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that inter-opinion
correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in
cultural space, a result unaccessible to one-dimensional analyses and in
striking contrast with random assumptions. When empirical data are used as
inputs in models, we find that ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive
effects, especially in the extreme case of long-range online-like interactions
bypassing social ties. On short time-scales, it strongly facilitates a
symmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On
long time-scales, it severely suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it
within disjoint groups. We therefore find that, remarkably, the empirical
distribution of individuals in cultural space appears to optimize the
coexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity,
which can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual
influence.

  Uncertain Structure","  Much of the past work in network analysis has focused on analyzing discrete
graphs, where binary edges represent the \"presence\" or \"absence\" of a
relationship. Since traditional network measures (e.g., betweenness centrality)
utilize a discrete link structure, complex systems must be transformed to this
representation in order to investigate network properties. However, in many
domains there may be uncertainty about the relationship structure and any
uncertainty information would be lost in translation to a discrete
representation. Uncertainty may arise in domains where there is moderating link
information that cannot be easily observed, i.e., links become inactive over
time but may not be dropped or observed links may not always corresponds to a
valid relationship. In order to represent and reason with these types of
uncertainty, we move beyond the discrete graph framework and develop social
network measures based on a probabilistic graph representation. More
specifically, we develop measures of path length, betweenness centrality, and
clustering coefficient---one set based on sampling and one based on
probabilistic paths. We evaluate our methods on three real-world networks from
Enron, Facebook, and DBLP, showing that our proposed methods more accurately
capture salient effects without being susceptible to local noise, and that the
resulting analysis produces a better understanding of the graph structure and
the uncertainty resulting from its change over time.

are randomly divided into two parts, the training set and the probe set. We
argue that this straightforward and standard method may lead to terrible bias,
since in real biological and information networks, missing links are more
likely to be links connecting low-degree nodes. We therefore study how to
uncover missing links with low-degree nodes, namely links in the probe set are
of lower degree products than a random sampling. Experimental analysis on ten
local similarity indices and four disparate real networks reveals a surprising
result that the Leicht-Holme-Newman index [E. A. Leicht, P. Holme, and M. E. J.
Newman, Phys. Rev. E 73, 026120 (2006)] performs the best, although it was
known to be one of the worst indices if the probe set is a random sampling of
all links. We further propose an parameter-dependent index, which considerably
improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we show the relevance of the
proposed index on three real sampling methods.

However, most existing administrative borders were determined by a variety of

Societies have changed drastically, and it is doubtful that currently existing
borders reflect the most logical divisions. Fortunately, at this point in
history we are in a position to actually measure some aspects of the geographic

such as trains and airlines provide data about the number of people traveling
between geographic locations, and many promising human mobility proxies are

network. In this paper we set out to analyze and characterize this network, as
captured by the IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), in two
ways. First, through an adaptation of the \"error and attack\" methodology [1],
we show that the network is of the \"robust-yet-fragile\" type, a topology found
in a wide variety of evolved networks. We compare these results against four
common null-models, generated only from first-order statistics of the empirical
data. In addition, we suggest a fifth, log-normal model, which generates
networks that seem to match the empirical one more closely. Still, this model
does not account for several higher order network statistics, which reenforces
the added value of the higher-order analysis. Second, using loss-given-default
dynamics [2], we model financial interdependence and potential cascading of
financial distress through the network. Preliminary simulations indicate that
default by a single relatively small country like Greece can be absorbed by the
network, but that default in combination with defaults of other PIGS countries
(Portugal, Ireland, and Spain) could lead to a massive extinction cascade in
the global economy.

laws with a negative exponent 1 such as the rank-size rule. The rank-size rule
is a very simple scaling law followed by many observations of the ubiquitous
empirical patterns in physical and social systems. Where there is a rank-size
distribution, there will be a hierarchy with cascade structure. However, the
equivalence relation between the rank-size rule and the hierarchical scaling
law remains to be mathematically demonstrated and empirically testified. In
this paper, theoretical derivation, mathematical experiments, and empirical
analysis are employed to show that the rank-size rule is equivalent in theory
to the hierarchical scaling law (the Nn principle). Abstracting an ordered set
of quantities in the form {1, 1/2,..., 1/k,...} from the rank-size rule, I
prove a geometric subdivision theorem of the harmonic sequence (k=1, 2, 3,...).
By the theorem, the rank-size distribution can be transformed into a
self-similar hierarchy, thus a power law can be decomposed as a pair of
exponential laws, and further the rank-size power law can be reconstructed as a
hierarchical scaling law. A number of ubiquitous empirical observations and
rules, including Zipf's law, Pareto's distribution, fractals, allometric
scaling, 1/f noise, can be unified into the hierarchical framework. The
self-similar hierarchy can provide us with a new perspective of looking at the
inverse power law of nature or even how nature works.

insights on the information lost by projecting the bipartite graph. We
illustrate the relevance of theses concepts on several real-world instances
illustrating how it enables to discriminate behaviors among various cases when
we compare them to a benchmark of random networks. Then, we show that we can

detail. We found that topological properties, such as traffic volume (between
airports) and degree of connectivity (of individual airports), including both
in- and outdegrees, follow a power law distribution but not a geometric
property like travel lengths. The travel lengths exhibit an exponential
distribution rather than a power law with an exponential cutoff as previous

topologies of airports with various moving behaviors and found that the
mobility patterns are mainly attributed to the underlying binary topology of
airports and have little to do with other factors, such as moving behaviors and
geometric distances. Apart from the above findings, this study adopts the
head/tail division rule, which is regularity behind any heavy-tailed
distribution for extracting individual airports. The adoption of this rule for

measures to characterize the vitality of a vertex in maintaining the integrity
of the network but not the only one. Damage, the decrease of the largest
component size that was caused by the removal of a vertex, intuitively is a
more destructive guide for intentional attack on networks since the network
functionality is usually measured by the largest component size. However, it is
surprising to find that little is known about behaviors of real networks or
synthetic networks against intentional attack guided by damage (damage attack),
in which adversaries always choose the vertex with the largest damage to
attack.
  In this article, we dedicate our efforts to understanding damage attack and
behaviors of real networks as well as synthetic networks against this attack.
To this end, existing attacking models, statistical properties of damage in
complex networks are first revisited. Then, we present the empirical analysis
results about behaviors of complex networks against damage attack with the
comparisons to degree attack. It is surprising to find a cross-point for
diverse networks before which damage attack is more destructive than degree
attack. Further investigation shows that the existence of cross-point can be
attributed to the fact that: degree attack tends produce networks with more
heterogenous damage distribution than damage attack. Results in this article
strongly suggest that damage attack is one of most destructive attacks and
deserves our research efforts.Our understandings about damage attack may also
shed light on efficient solutions to protect real networks against damage
attack.

daily deals on the web, based on a dataset we compiled by monitoring Groupon
over several weeks. We use our dataset to characterize Groupon deal purchases,
and to glean insights about Groupon's operational strategy. Our focus is on
purchase incentives. For the primary purchase incentive, price, our regression
model indicates that demand for coupons is relatively inelastic, allowing room
for price-based revenue optimization. More interestingly, mining our dataset,
we find evidence that Groupon customers are sensitive to other, \"soft\",
incentives, e.g., deal scheduling and duration, deal featuring, and limited
inventory. Our analysis points to the importance of considering incentives
other than price in optimizing deal sites and similar systems.

  Matching","  Animals living in groups make movement decisions that depend, among other
factors, on social interactions with other group members. Our present
understanding of social rules in animal collectives is mainly based on
empirical fits to observations, with less emphasis in obtaining
first-principles approaches that allow their derivation. Here we show that
patterns of collective decisions can be derived from the basic ability of
animals to make probabilistic estimations in the presence of uncertainty. We
build a decision-making model with two stages: Bayesian estimation and
probabilistic matching. In the first stage, each animal makes a Bayesian
estimation of which behavior is best to perform taking into account personal
information about the environment and social information collected by observing
the behaviors of other animals. In the probability matching stage, each animal
chooses a behavior with a probability equal to the Bayesian-estimated
probability that this behavior is the most appropriate one. This model derives
very simple rules of interaction in animal collectives that depend only on two
types of reliability parameters, one that each animal assigns to the other
animals and another given by the quality of the non-social information. We test
our model by obtaining theoretically a rich set of observed collective patterns
of decisions in three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, a shoaling
fish species. The quantitative link shown between probabilistic estimation and
collective rules of behavior allows a better contact with other fields such as
foraging, mate selection, neurobiology and psychology, and gives predictions
for experiments directly testing the relationship between estimation and
collective behavior.

of our times. Based on mining several million citations, we quantitatively
analyze the processes driving paradigm shifts in science. We find that
groundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize Laureates and other famous scientists
are not only acknowledged by many citations of their landmark papers.
Surprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous
publications. Given that innovations must outcompete the rich-gets-richer
effect for scientific citations, it turns out that they can make their way only
through citation cascades. A quantitative analysis reveals how and why they
happen. Science appears to behave like a self-organized critical system, in
which citation cascades of all sizes occur, from continuous scientific progress
all the way up to scientific revolutions, which change the way we see our
world. Measuring the \"boosting effect\" of landmark papers, our analysis reveals
how new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world
dominated by established paradigms. The underlying \"boost factor\" is also
useful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than
through classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread
method to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the
distribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective
social behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics
perspective. Understanding the origin of scientific authority may therefore
ultimately help to explain, how social influence comes about and why the value
of goods depends so strongly on the attention they attract.

well-characterized model of cellular dynamics. S. cerevisiae is an appropriate
model organism, since both its protein-protein interaction network
(interactome) and stress response at the gene expression level have been well
characterized. However, the analysis of the reorganization of the yeast
interactome during stress has not been investigated yet. We calculated the
changes of the interaction-weights of the yeast interactome from the changes of
mRNA expression levels upon heat shock. The major finding of our study is that
heat shock induced a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections
of yeast interactome modules. In agreement with this the weighted diameter of
the yeast interactome had a 4.9-fold increase in heat shock. Several key
proteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local
communities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules
after heat shock. The observed changes resemble to a \"stratus-cumulus\" type
transition of the interactome structure, since the unstressed yeast interactome
had a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds,
whereas the heat shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to
that of cumulus clouds. Our results showed that heat shock induces a partial
disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome. This change
may be rather general occurring in many types of stresses. Moreover, other
complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks and ecosystems may
also decrease their inter-modular links, thus develop more compact modules, and
display a partial disintegration of their global structure in the initial phase
of crisis. Thus, our work may provide a model of a general, system-level
adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.

understanding of the underlying structures in complex data sets. For instance,
in restaurant recommendation systems, recommendations can be based on rating
histories of customers. In addition to rating histories, customers' social
networks (e.g., Facebook friendships) and restaurant categories information
(e.g., Thai or Italian) can also be used to make better recommendations. The
task of fusing data, however, is challenging since data sets can be incomplete
and heterogeneous, i.e., data consist of both matrices, e.g., the person by
person social network matrix or the restaurant by category matrix, and
higher-order tensors, e.g., the \"ratings\" tensor of the form restaurant by meal
by person.
  In this paper, we are particularly interested in fusing data sets with the
goal of capturing their underlying latent structures. We formulate this problem
as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem where heterogeneous
data sets are modeled by fitting outer-product models to higher-order tensors
and matrices in a coupled manner. Unlike traditional approaches solving this
problem using alternating algorithms, we propose an all-at-once optimization
approach called CMTF-OPT (CMTF-OPTimization), which is a gradient-based
optimization approach for joint analysis of matrices and higher-order tensors.
We also extend the algorithm to handle coupled incomplete data sets. Using
numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed all-at-once approach is
more accurate than the alternating least squares approach.

Our results shows that disassortative networks exhibit a higher epidemiological

Moreover, we study by computer simulations the sandpile cascade model, a

P\'{o}lya on d-dimensional lattices -- has potential as a measure for the

probability distributions for connected undirected graphs. We argue that return
probability has the same discriminatory power as existing k-step measures -- in
particular, beta centrality (with negative beta), the graph-theoretical power
index (GPI), and subgraph centrality. We compare the running time of our
algorithm to beta centrality and subgraph centrality and find that it is
significantly faster. When return probability is used to measure the same
phenomena as beta centrality, it runs in linear time -- O(n+m), where n and m
are the number of nodes and edges, respectively -- which takes much less time
than either the matrix inversion or the sequence of matrix multiplications
required for calculating the exact or approximate forms of beta centrality,
respectively. We call this form of return probability the P\'{o}lya power index
(PPI). Computing subgraph centrality requires an expensive eigendecomposition
of the adjacency matrix; return probability runs in half the time of the
eigendecomposition on a 2000-node network. These performance improvements are
important because computationally efficient measures are necessary in order to
analyze large networks.

Here, we use publicly available data from 101,853 users of online social media
collected over a time period of almost six months to measure the
spatio-temporal sentiment towards a new vaccine. We validated our approach by
identifying a strong correlation between sentiments expressed online and CDC-
estimated vaccination rates by region. Analysis of the network of opinionated
users showed that information flows more often between users who share the same
sentiments - and less often between users who do not share the same sentiments
- than expected by chance alone. We also found that most communities are
dominated by either positive or negative sentiments towards the novel vaccine.
Simulations of infectious disease transmission show that if clusters of
negative vaccine sentiments lead to clusters of unprotected individuals, the
likelihood of disease outbreaks are greatly increased. Online social media
provide unprecedented access to data allowing for inexpensive and efficient
tools to identify target areas for intervention efforts and to evaluate their

concepts, which play a significant role in the study of complexity science. The
coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law motivates different
understandings on the dependence between these two scalings, which is still
hardly been clarified.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this article, we observe an evolution
process of the scalings: the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law are naturally shaped
to coexist at the initial time, while the crossover comes with the emergence of
their inconsistency at the larger time before reaching a stable state, where
the Heaps' law still exists with the disappearance of strict Zipf's law. Such
findings are illustrated with a scenario of large-scale spatial epidemic
spreading, and the empirical results of pandemic disease support a universal
analysis of the relation between the two laws regardless of the biological
details of disease. Employing the United States(U.S.) domestic air
transportation and demographic data to construct a metapopulation model for
simulating the pandemic spread at the U.S. country level, we uncover that the
broad heterogeneity of the infrastructure plays a key role in the evolution of
scaling emergence.
  Conclusions/Significance: The analyses of large-scale spatial epidemic
spreading help understand the temporal evolution of scalings, indicating the
coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law depends on the collective
dynamics of epidemic processes, and the heterogeneity of epidemic spread
indicates the significance of performing targeted containment strategies at the
early time of a pandemic disease.

by analyzing the data related to product reviewing on Amazon.com. We found
several segments, a kind of hybrid communities of densely interlinked reviewers
and products, which we were able to meaningfully interpret in terms of the type
and thematic categorization of reviewed items. The method provides a
complementary approach to other ways of community detection, typically aiming
at identification of large network modules.

typically collect a relatively small fraction of nodes and their associated
edges. Past work in this area has primarily focused on obtaining a
representative sample of nodes and on efficient estimation of local graph
properties (such as node degree distribution or any node attribute) based on
that sample. However, less is known about estimating the global topology of the
underlying graph.
  In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate the coarse-grained
topology of a graph from a probability sample of nodes. In particular, we
consider that nodes are partitioned into categories (e.g., countries or
work/study places in OSNs), which naturally defines a weighted category graph.
We are interested in estimating (i) the size of categories and (ii) the
probability that nodes from two different categories are connected. For each of
the above, we develop a family of estimators for design-based inference under
uniform or non-uniform sampling, employing either of two measurement
strategies: induced subgraph sampling, which relies only on information about
the sampled nodes; and star sampling, which also exploits category information
about the neighbors of sampled nodes. We prove consistency of these estimators
and evaluate their efficiency via simulation on fully known graphs. We also
apply our methodology to a sample of Facebook users to obtain a number of
category graphs, such as the college friendship graph and the country
friendship graph; we share and visualize the resulting data at

results coincide with previous findings that, based purely on topological

shortest-path betweenness analysis, where shortest paths are calculated from
each pairs of nodes, carries an unrealistic implicit assumption that each node
or junction in the urban network generates and attracts an equal amount of
traffic. We also argue that weighting edges based only on euclidean distance is
inadequate, as primary roads are commonly favoured over secondary roads due to
the perceived and actual travel time required. We show that betweenness traffic
analysis can be improved by a simple extended framework which incorporates both
the notions of node weights and fastest-path betweenness. We demonstrate that
the framework is superior to traditional methods based solely on simple

dichotomous network data, in part because they give rise to a Bernoulli product
likelihood that is both well understood and consistent with the notion of
exchangeable random graphs. In this article we propose conservative confidence
sets that hold with respect to these underlying Bernoulli parameters as a
function of any given partition of network nodes, enabling us to assess
estimates of 'residual' network structure, that is, structure that cannot be
explained by known covariates and thus cannot be easily verified by manual
inspection. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing student
friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health
that include race, gender, and school year as covariates. We employ a
stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm to fit a logistic regression
model that includes these explanatory variables as well as a latent stochastic
blockmodel component and additional node-specific effects. Although
maximum-likelihood estimates do not appear consistent in this context, we are
able to evaluate confidence sets as a function of different blockmodel
partitions, which enables us to qualitatively assess the significance of
estimated residual network structure relative to a baseline, which models
covariates but lacks block structure.

complex network analysis. As more data has been collected, researchers have
begun investigating changing community structure across multiple networks.
Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these are
limited to evolution of a single network over time. In addition, most of the
existing methods are more concerned with change at the community level than at
the level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaled
inclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structure
across networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of the
classiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, the
method can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In this
paper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks of
United States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that play
in the top division of American college football. We found that scaled
inclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodes
in both sets of networks. We propose that scaled inclusivity may provide a
useful way to quantify the change in a network's community structure.

way they lead to the formation of an organized and functional society are
important issues especially for techno-social development. Addressing these
issues of social networks has recently become possible through large scale data
analysis of e.g. mobile phone call records, which has revealed the existence of
modular or community structure with many links between nodes of the same
community and relatively few links between nodes of different communities. The
weights of links, e.g. the number of calls between two users, and the network
topology are found correlated such that intra-community links are stronger
compared to the weak inter-community links. This is known as Granovetter's \"The
strength of weak ties\" hypothesis. In addition to this inhomogeneous community
structure, the temporal patterns of human dynamics turn out to be inhomogeneous
or bursty, characterized by the heavy tailed distribution of inter-event time
between two consecutive events. In this paper, we study how the community
structure and the bursty dynamics emerge together in an evolving weighted
network model. The principal mechanisms behind these patterns are social
interaction by cyclic closure, i.e. links to friends of friends and the focal
closure, i.e. links to individuals sharing similar attributes or interests, and
human dynamics by task handling process. These three mechanisms have been
implemented as a network model with local attachment, global attachment, and
priority-based queuing processes. By comprehensive numerical simulations we
show that the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the emergence of heavy
tailed inter-event time distribution and the evolution of Granovetter-type
community structure. Moreover, the numerical results are found to be in
qualitative agreement with empirical results from mobile phone call dataset.

trends driving an asset price in a given market. Initially, each agent decides
to buy or sell according to its personal opinion, which results from the
combination of its own private information, the public information and its own
analysis. It then adjusts such opinion through the market as it observes
sequentially the behavior of a group of random selection of other agents. Its
choice is then determined by a local majority rule including itself. Whenever
the selected group is at a tie, i.e., it is undecided on what to do, the choice
is determined by the local group belief with respect to the anticipated trend
at that time. These local adjustments create a dynamic that leads the market
price formation. In case of balanced anticipations the market is found to be
efficient in being successful to make the \"right price\" to emerge from the
sequential aggregation of all the local individual informations which all
together contain the fundamental value. However, when a leading optimistic
belief prevails, the same efficient market mechanisms are found to produce a
bullish dynamic even though most agents have bearish private informations. The
market yields then a wider and wider discrepancy between the fundamental value
and the market value, which in turn creates a speculative bubble. Nevertheless,
there exists a limit in the growing of the bubble where private opinions take
over again and at once invert the trend, originating a sudden bearish trend.
Moreover, in the case of a drastic shift in the collective expectations, a huge
drop in price levels may also occur extremely fast and puts the market out of
control, it is a market crash.

systems and novel technologies, it is today possible to produce and analyze
social and biological networks with detailed information on the time of
occurrence and duration of each link. However, standard graph metrics
introduced so far in complex network theory are mainly suited for static
graphs, i.e., graphs in which the links do not change over time, or graphs
built from time-varying systems by aggregating all the links as if they were
concurrent in time. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectedness, and
the definitions of node and graph components, to the case of time-varying
graphs, which are represented as time-ordered sequences of graphs defined over
a fixed set of nodes. We show that the problem of finding strongly connected
components in a time-varying graph can be mapped into the problem of
discovering the maximal-cliques in an opportunely constructed static graph,
which we name the affine graph. It is therefore an NP-complete problem. As a
practical example, we have performed a temporal component analysis of
time-varying graphs constructed from three data sets of human interactions. The
results show that taking time into account in the definition of graph
components allows to capture important features of real systems. In particular,
we observe a large variability in the size of node temporal in- and
out-components. This is due to intrinsic fluctuations in the activity patterns
of individuals, which cannot be detected by static graph analysis.

Extensive simulations show that the heterogeneity of activities at population

Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields,
several key questions still remain unanswered. The understanding of how

challenging issues requiring a thorough analysis of opinion per se but also of
the way in which they travel between agents' minds and are modulated by these
exchanges. To account for the two-faceted nature of opinions, which are mental
entities undergoing complex social processes, we outline a preliminary model in

investigating social influence also implies the necessity to account for the

the spreading of information in social networks. We study the correlations
between tie strengths and topology in networks of scientific collaboration, and
show that these are very different from ordinary social networks. For the
latter, it has earlier been shown that strong ties are associated with dense
network neighborhoods, while weaker ties act as bridges between these. Because
of this, weak links act as bottlenecks for the diffusion of information. We
show that on the contrary, in co-authorship networks dense local neighborhoods
mainly consist of weak links, whereas strong links are more important for
overall connectivity. The important role of strong links is further highlighted
in simulations of information spreading, where their topological position is
seen to dramatically speed up spreading dynamics. Thus, in contrast to ordinary
social networks, weight-topology correlations enhance the flow of information
across scientific collaboration networks.

communities in large complex networks. Furthermore, due to its simplicity, it
is also currently one of the most commonly adopted algorithms in the
literature. Despite various subsequent advances, an important issue of the
algorithm has not yet been properly addressed. Random (node) update orders
within the algorithm severely hamper its robustness, and consequently also the
stability of the identified community structure. We note that an update order
can be seen as increasing propagation preferences from certain nodes, and
propose a balanced propagation that counteracts for the introduced randomness
by utilizing node balancers. We have evaluated the proposed approach on
synthetic networks with planted partition, and on several real-world networks
with community structure. The results confirm that balanced propagation is
significantly more robust than label propagation, when the performance of
community detection is even improved. Thus, balanced propagation retains high
scalability and algorithmic simplicity of label propagation, but improves on
its stability and performance.

  dynamics","  The heavy-tailed inter-event time distributions are widely observed in many
human-activated systems, which may result from both endogenous mechanisms like
the highest-priority-first protocol and exogenous factors like the varying
global activity versus time. To distinguish the effects on temporal statistics
from different mechanisms is this of theoretical significance. In this Letter,
we propose a new timing method by using a relative clock, where the time length
between two consecutive events of an individual is counted as the number of
other individuals' events appeared during this interval. We propose a model, in
which agents act either in a constant rate or with a power-law inter-event time
distribution, and the global activity either keeps unchanged or varies
periodically versus time. Our analysis shows that the heavy tails caused by the
heterogeneity of global activity can be eliminated by setting the relative
clock, yet the heterogeneity due to real individual behaviors still exists. We
perform extensive experiments on four large-scale systems, the search engine by
AOL, a social bookmarking system--Delicious, a short-message communication
network, and a microblogging system--Twitter. Strong heterogeneity and clear
seasonality of global activity are observed, but the heavy tails cannot be
eliminated by using the relative clock. Our results suggest the existence of
endogenous heterogeneity of human dynamics.

a unified framework and analogous models. In this paper, we propose a model to
emphasize the essential difference between information spreading and epidemic
spreading, where the memory effects, the social reinforcement and the
non-redundancy of contacts are taken into account. Under certain conditions,
the information spreads faster and broader in regular networks than in random
networks, which to some extent supports the recent experimental observation of
spreading in online society [D. Centola, Science {\bf 329}, 1194 (2010)]. At
the same time, simulation result indicates that the random networks tend to be
favorable for effective spreading when the network size increases. This
challenges the validity of the above-mentioned experiment for large-scale
systems. More significantly, we show that the spreading effectiveness can be
sharply enhanced by introducing a little randomness into the regular structure,
namely the small-world networks yield the most effective information spreading.
Our work provides insights to the understanding of the role of local clustering
in information spreading.

competitors; however, there are a few companies that are considered as

headquarters strongly correlates with local population density, and the
probability two firms are competitors declines with geographic distance. We
construct these properties by growing a corporate network with competitive

community structure in graphs. The resolution limit of the method is supposedly
solvable with the introduction of modified versions of the measure, with
tunable resolution parameters. We show that multiresolution modularity suffers
from two opposite coexisting problems: the tendency to merge small subgraphs,
which dominates when the resolution is low; the tendency to split large
subgraphs, which dominates when the resolution is high. In benchmark networks
with heterogeneous distributions of cluster sizes, the simultaneous elimination
of both biases is not possible and multiresolution modularity is not capable to
recover the planted community structure, not even when it is pronounced and
easily detectable by other methods, for any value of the resolution parameter.
This holds for other multiresolution techniques and it is likely to be a
general problem of methods based on global optimization.

Our network is made up by users that exchanged tweets in a time period of one
month, which includes the birth and stabilization of the 15M movement. We
characterize in depth the growth of such dynamical network and find that it is
scale-free with communities at the mesoscale. We also find that its dynamics

recommendation process are investigated on both the real networks and the
reshuffled networks in which real users' behavior patterns can be gradually

Detail study on each item shows that recommendation accuracy for hot items is

show that such a network is indeed usable by constructing a botnet on top of

steal information from its victims. Unlike conventional botnets, Stegobot
traffic does not introduce new communication endpoints between bots. We
analyzed a real-world dataset of image sharing between members of an online

stealthy as it is, it is also functionally powerful -- capable of channeling
fair quantities of sensitive data from its victims to the botmaster at tens of

object of interdisciplinary research. As with face-to-face meetings, Internet
exchanges may not only include factual information but also emotional
information - how participants feel about the subject discussed or other group
members. Emotions are known to be important in affecting interaction partners
in offline communication in many ways. Could emotions in Internet exchanges
affect others and systematically influence quantitative and qualitative aspects
of the trajectory of e-communities? The development of automatic sentiment
analysis has made large scale emotion detection and analysis possible using
text messages collected from the web. It is not clear if emotions in
e-communities primarily derive from individual group members' personalities or
if they result from intra-group interactions, and whether they influence group
activities. We show the collective character of affective phenomena on a large
scale as observed in 4 million posts downloaded from Blogs, Digg and BBC
forums. To test whether the emotions of a community member may influence the
emotions of others, posts were grouped into clusters of messages with similar
emotional valences. The frequency of long clusters was much higher than it
would be if emotions occurred at random. Distributions for cluster lengths can
be explained by preferential processes because conditional probabilities for
consecutive messages grow as a power law with cluster length. For BBC forum
threads, average discussion lengths were higher for larger values of absolute
average emotional valence in the first ten comments and the average amount of
emotion in messages fell during discussions. Our results prove that collective
emotional states can be created and modulated via Internet communication and
that emotional expressiveness is the fuel that sustains some e-communities.

appearances. We focus on words that show dynamic growth and decay with a
tendency to diverge on a certain day. After careful pretreatment and fitting
method, we found power laws generally approximate the functional forms of

observe news words whose frequency increase suddenly and decay following power

The model suggests that bloggers are not only responding to the latest number

for estimating the period to return to the normal fluctuation level.

networks, protein interactions in biological networks, and Internet traffic
analysis. The arrival of massive graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes,
e.g. social graphs, presents a unique challenge to graph analysis applications.
Most of these applications rely on computing distances between node pairs,
which for large graphs can take minutes to compute using traditional algorithms
such as breadth-first-search (BFS). In this paper, we study ways to enable
scalable graph processing on today's massive graphs. We explore the design
space of graph coordinate systems, a new approach that accurately approximates
node distances in constant time by embedding graphs into coordinate spaces. We
show that a hyperbolic embedding produces relatively low distortion error, and
propose Rigel, a hyperbolic graph coordinate system that lends itself to
efficient parallelization across a compute cluster. Rigel produces
significantly more accurate results than prior systems, and is naturally
parallelizable across compute clusters, allowing it to provide accurate results
for graphs up to 43 million nodes. Finally, we show that Rigel's functionality
can be easily extended to locate (near-) shortest paths between node pairs.
After a one- time preprocessing cost, Rigel answers node-distance queries in
10's of microseconds, and also produces shortest path results up to 18 times
faster than prior shortest-path systems with similar levels of accuracy.

of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks
to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct
self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is
relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10%
of citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for
citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences
between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship
which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also
in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a
propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network.
Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration
network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references,
we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of
the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have
implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of
citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific
disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important
practical implications for the availability of 'arm's length' expert reviewers

  peer production systems","  Commons-based peer production does seem to rest upon a paradox. Although
users produce all contents, at the same time participation is commonly on a
voluntary basis, and largely incentivized by achievement of project's goals.
This means that users have to coordinate their actions and goals, in order to
keep themselves from leaving. While this situation is easily explainable for
small groups of highly committed, like-minded individuals, little is known
about large-scale, heterogeneous projects, such as Wikipedia.
  In this contribution we present a model of peer production in a large online
community. The model features a dynamic population of bounded confidence users,
and an endogenous process of user departure. Using global sensitivity analysis,
we identify the most important parameters affecting the lifespan of user
participation. We find that the model presents two distinct regimes, and that
the shift between them is governed by the bounded confidence parameter. For low
values of this parameter, users depart almost immediately. For high values,
however, the model produces a bimodal distribution of user lifespan. These
results suggest that user participation to online communities could be
explained in terms of group consensus, and provide a novel connection between
models of opinion dynamics and commons-based peer production.

guide the design of efficient graph algorithms. In particular, the Power-law
degree distribution has long been used to model the structure of online social
networks, and is the basis for algorithms and heuristics in graph applications
such as influence maximization and social search. Along with recent measurement
results, our interest in this topic was sparked by our own experimental results
on social graphs that deviated significantly from those predicted by a
Power-law model. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of these
deviations, and propose an alternative model with significant implications on
graph algorithms and applications. We start by quantifying this artifact using
a variety of real social graphs, and show that their structures cannot be
accurately modeled using elementary distributions including the Power-law.
Instead, we propose the Pareto-Lognormal (PLN) model, verify its
goodness-of-fit using graphical and statistical methods, and present an
analytical study of its asymptotical differences with the Power-law. To
demonstrate the quantitative benefits of the PLN model, we compare the results
of three wide-ranging graph applications on real social graphs against those on
synthetic graphs generated using the PLN and Power-law models. We show that
synthetic graphs generated using PLN are much better predictors of degree
distributions in real graphs, and produce experimental results with errors that
are orders-of-magnitude smaller than those produced by the Power-law model.

National and Sectoral Innovation Systems literature has become bogged down,
however, into case studies of how specific institutions affect innovation in a
specific country. A useful notion for policy makers in particular, Balzat &
Hanusch (2004) argued that there is a need for NIS studies to develop
complementary and also quantitative methods in order to generate new insights
that are comparable across national borders. We use data for patents granted by
the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to map innovation systems.
Groupings of patents into primary and secondary classes (co-classification) can
be used as relational indicators. Knowledge from one class may be more easily
used in another class when a co-classification relation exists. Using social
network analysis, we map the co-classification of patents among classes and
thus indicate what characterizes an innovation system. A main contribution of
this paper is methodological, adding to the repertoire of methods NIS studies
use and using information from patents in a different way. Policy makers may
also find benefits in the social network analysis of the complete set of
patents granted by the WIPO to firms and individuals in a country. Social
network analysis indicates what innovation activity occurs in a countries and
which fields of technology are likely to give rise to innovative products in
the near future. We offer such analysis for the Dutch and Indian Innovation
Systems. This social network analysis could also be done for a Sector

  Online Social Networks","  Online social networks have recently become an effective and innovative
channel for spreading information and influence among hundreds of millions of
end users. Many prior work have carried out empirical studies and proposed
diffusion models to understand the information diffusion process in online
social networks. However, most of these studies focus on the information
diffusion in temporal dimension, that is, how the information propagates over
time. Little attempt has been given on understanding information diffusion over
both temporal and spatial dimensions. In this paper, we propose a Partial
Differential Equation (PDE), specifically, a Diffusive Logistic (DL) equation
to model the temporal and spatial characteristics of information diffusion in
online social networks. To be more specific, we develop a PDE-based theoretical
framework to measure and predict the density of influenced users at a given
distance from the original information source after a time period. The density
of influenced users over time and distance provides valuable insight on the
actual information diffusion process. We present the temporal and spatial
patterns in a real dataset collected from Digg social news site, and validate
the proposed DL equation in terms of predicting the information diffusion
process. Our experiment results show that the DL model is indeed able to
characterize and predict the process of information propagation in online
social networks. For example, for the most popular news with 24,099 votes in
Digg, the average prediction accuracy of DL model over all distances during the
first 6 hours is 92.08%. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
attempt to use PDE-based model to study the information diffusion process in

globally coupled to a common environmental source of information. The
environmental stimuli were given in a form of referee's decisions list. The
sample of fans had to respond on each stimulus by associating points signifying
his/her own opinion, emotion and action that referee's decisions provoke. Data
were fitted by the Brillouin function which was a solution of an adapted model
of quantum statistical physics to social phenomena. Correlation and a principal
component analysis were performed in order to detect any collective behavior of
the social ensemble of fans. Results showed that fans behaved as a system
subject to a phase transition where the neutral state in the opinion, emotional
and action space has been destabilized and a new stable state of coherent
attitudes was formed. The enhancement of fluctuations and the increase of
social susceptibility (responsiveness) to referee's decisions were connected to
the first few decisions. The subsequent reduction of values in these parameters
signified the onset of coherent layering within the attitude space of the
social ensemble of fans. In the space of opinions fan coherence was maximal as
only one layer of coherence emerged. In the emotional and action spaces the
number of coherent levels was 2 and 4 respectively. The principal component
analysis revealed a strong collective behavior and a high degree of integration
within and between the opinion, emotional and action spaces of the sample of
fans. These results point to one possible way of how different proto-groups,
violent and moderate, may be formed as a consequence of global coupling to a
common source of information.

performed. In such a scenario a frequency based method of investigation is
developed to obtain useful insights on the network. The information thus
derived can be fruitfully exploited to build acyclic graphical models, which
can be seen as extension of Bayesian Networks or Markov Chains. Moreover, it is

detailed theoretical analysis for the behaviour of the model, investigate its
behaviou r in the thermodynamic limit, and argue that it provides a simple
example of a topology-driven model whose behaviour is strongly reminiscent of a
first-order phase transitions far from equilibrium.

of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids --
can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure,
describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize
the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not
continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email,
text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or
practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for
non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at
hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals
is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the
temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems
interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of
patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we
present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for
analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their
relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional
network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when
things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself.
Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not
necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite
different from those for static networks.

product-product projected networks and introduce a novel method of filtering
information based on elements' similarity. As a result we find that country
clustering reveals unexpected socio-geographic links among the most competing
countries. On the same footings the products clustering can be efficiently used
for a bottom-up classification of produced goods. Furthermore we mathematically
reformulate the \"reflections method\" introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann as a
fixpoint problem; such formulation highlights some conceptual weaknesses of the
approach. To overcome such an issue, we introduce an alternative methodology
(based on biased Markov chains) that allows to rank countries in a conceptually
consistent way. Our analysis uncovers a strong non-linear interaction between
the diversification of a country and the ubiquity of its products, thus
suggesting the possible need of moving towards more efficient and direct
non-linear fixpoint algorithms to rank countries and products in the global

the analysis of roll call data. We present a new data-driven model for roll
call voting that is geometric in nature. We construct the model by adapting the
\"Partition Decoupling Method,\" an unsupervised learning technique originally
developed for the analysis of families of time series, to produce a multiscale
geometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call
votes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a \"motivation,\" a
cluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the
representation of roll call data. Motivations enable the formulation of a
quantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes
possible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This
approach is generally applicable to roll call data and we apply it in
particular to the historical roll call voting of the U.S. House and Senate.
This methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the
underlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low-
(one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding
higher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the
findings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the
dimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several
individual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to
determine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as
a predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial
models such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder
6-factor model, both in raw accuracy as well as Aggregate Proportional Reduced

asking for the \"most influential\" actors in itself is an ill-posed question,

quantitatively compare different measures of influence. Furthermore, when we

users voluntarily signal their current location, opens the door to powerful
studies on human movement. In particular the fine granularity of the location
data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of
Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility
patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing
a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in
human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are
predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban
environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which
isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of
places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as
considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a
rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different
cities. Our results shed new light on the driving factors of urban human
mobility, with potential applications for urban planning, location-based

in the NON system. We study and compare both $n$ coupled Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
(ER) graphs and $n$ coupled random regular (RR) graphs. We found recently [Gao
et. al. arXive:1010.5829] that for an NON composed of $n$ ER networks each of
average degree $k$, the giant component, $P_{\infty}$, is given by
$P_{\infty}=p[1-\exp(-kP_{\infty})]^n$ where $1-p$ is the initial fraction of
removed nodes. Our general result coincides for $n=1$ with the known
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi second-order phase transition at a threshold, $p=p_c$, for
a single network. For $n=2$ the general result for $P_{\infty}$ corresponds to
the $n=2$ result [Buldyrev et. al., Nature, 464, (2010)]. Similar to the ER
NON, for $n=1$ the percolation transition at $p_c$, is of second order while
for any $n>1$ it is of first order. The first order percolation transition in
both ER and RR (for $n>1$) is accompanied by cascading failures between the
networks due to their interdependencies. However, we find that the robustness
of $n$ coupled RR networks of degree $k$ is dramatically higher compared to the
$n$ coupled ER networks of average degree $k$. While for ER NON there exists a
critical minimum average degree $k=k_{\min}$, that increases with $n$, below
which the system collapses, there is no such analogous $k_{\min}$ for RR NON

Using these InfTucker, we conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature

both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous
Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent
Gaussian or $t$ processes with nonlinear covariance functions. To efficiently
learn the InfTucker from data, we develop a variational inference technique on

high state requirement and do not provide an adequate level of privacy. For
instance, such techniques require a user to reveal their social network
contacts. We design X-Vine, a protection mechanism for distributed hash tables
that operates entirely by communicating over social network links. As with
traditional peer-to-peer systems, X-Vine provides robustness, scalability, and
a platform for innovation. The use of social network links for communication
helps protect participant privacy and adds a new dimension of trust absent from
previous designs. X-Vine is resilient to denial of service via Sybil attacks,
and in fact is the first Sybil defense that requires only a logarithmic amount
of state per node, making it suitable for large-scale and dynamic settings.
X-Vine also helps protect the privacy of users social network contacts and
keeps their IP addresses hidden from those outside of their social circle,
providing a basis for pseudonymous communication. We first evaluate our design
with analysis and simulations, using several real world large-scale social
networking topologies. We show that the constraints of X-Vine allow the
insertion of only a logarithmic number of Sybil identities per attack edge; we
show this mitigates the impact of malicious attacks while not affecting the

low stretch, and avoid hot spots in the network. We validate our design with a

  and Graph Clustering Methods","  Mobile on-body sensing has distinct advantages for the analysis and
understanding of crowd dynamics: sensing is not geographically restricted to a
specific instrumented area, mobile phones offer on-body sensing and they are
already deployed on a large scale, and the rich sets of sensors they contain
allows one to characterize the behavior of users through pattern recognition
techniques.
  In this paper we present a methodological framework for the machine
recognition of crowd behavior from on-body sensors, such as those in mobile
phones. The recognition of crowd behaviors opens the way to the acquisition of
large-scale datasets for the analysis and understanding of crowd dynamics. It
has also practical safety applications by providing improved crowd situational
awareness in cases of emergency.
  The framework comprises: behavioral recognition with the user's mobile
device, pairwise analyses of the activity relatedness of two users, and graph
clustering in order to uncover globally, which users participate in a given
crowd behavior. We illustrate this framework for the identification of groups
of persons walking, using empirically collected data.
  We discuss the challenges and research avenues for theoretical and applied
mathematics arising from the mobile sensing of crowd behaviors.

detailed information on the spread of the HIV epidemic. Here we study the
evolution of the sexual contact graph of detected individuals and also the
directed graph of HIV infections. The study covers the Cuban HIV epidemic
between the years 1986 and 2004 inclusive and is motivated by an earlier study
on the static properties of the network at the end of 2004. We use a variety of
advanced graph algorithms to paint a picture of the growth of the epidemic,
including an examination of diameters, geodesic distances, community structure
and centrality amongst others characteristics. The analysis contrasts the HIV
network with other real networks, and graphs generated using the configuration
model. We find that the early epidemic starts in the heterosexual population
and then grows mainly through MSM (Men having Sex with Men) contact. The
epidemic exhibits a giant component which is shown to have degenerate chains of
vertices and after 1989, diameters are larger than that expected by the
equivalent configuration model graphs. In 1997 there is an significant increase
in the detection rate from 73 to 256 detections/year covering mainly MSMs which
results in a rapid increase of distances and diameters in the giant component.

quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different
parts of a system. To this end, several notions of communicability have been
introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent
years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is
emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place
through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been
sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In
contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are
defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning
smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the
definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the
exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument
is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the
network. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a
network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both
classical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions.
Applications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are
illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last
part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex
networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly
reduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability
functions for large networks.

  Networks","  Over the last years, a great deal of attention has been focused on complex
networked systems, characterized by intricate structure and dynamics. The
latter has been often represented in terms of overall statistics (e.g. average
and standard deviations) of the time signals. While such approaches have led to
many insights, they have failed to take into account that signals at different
parts of the system can undergo distinct evolutions, which cannot be properly
represented in terms of average values. A novel framework for identifying the
principal aspects of the dynamics and how it is influenced by the network
structure is proposed in this work. The potential of this approach is
illustrated with respect to three important models (Integrate-and-Fire, SIS and
Kuramoto), allowing the identification of highly structured dynamics, in the
sense that different groups of nodes not only presented specific dynamics but
also felt the structure of the network in different ways.

opinions, A and B exist. Then we introduce contrarians which hold a strong B
opinion into the opinion A group. Through their interactions, the contrarians
are able to decrease the size of the largest A opinion cluster, and even
destroy it. We see this kind of method in operation, e.g when companies send
free new products to potential customers in order to convince them to adopt the
product and influence others. We study the CO model, using two different
strategies, on both ER and scale-free networks. In strategy I, the contrarians
are positioned at random. In strategy II, the contrarians are chosen to be the
highest degrees nodes. We find that for both strategies the size of the largest
A cluster decreases to zero as p increases as in a phase transition. At a
critical threshold value p_c the system undergoes a second-order phase
transition that belongs to the same universality class of mean field
percolation. We find that even for an ER type model, where the degrees of the

reducing the size of the largest A opinion cluster and, at very small values of

applications that a statistical mechanical description of the human behavior
may have in our society. By using this framework, we address this work to cover
an open question related to elections: the choice of elections candidates
(candidature process). Our analysis reveals that, apart from the social
motivations, this system displays features of traditional out-of-equilibrium
physical phenomena such as scale-free statistics and universality. Basically,
we found a non-linear (power law) mean correspondence between the number of
candidates and the size of the electorate (number of voters), and also that
this choice has a multiplicative underlying process (lognormal behavior). The
universality of our findings is supported by data from 16 elections from 5
countries. In addition, we show that aspects of network scale-free can be
connected to this universal behavior.

social groups, to rank Web pages by their popularity, and even to determine the
impact of scientific researches. The centrality score of a node within a
network crucially depends on the entire pattern of connections, so that the
usual approach is to compute the node centralities once the network structure
is assigned. We face here with the inverse problem, that is, we study how to
modify the centrality scores of the nodes by acting on the structure of a given
network. We prove that there exist particular subsets of nodes, called
controlling sets, which can assign any prescribed set of centrality values to
all the nodes of a graph, by cooperatively tuning the weights of their
out-going links. We show that many large networks from the real world have
surprisingly small controlling sets, containing even less than 5-10% of the
nodes. These results suggest that rankings obtained from spectral centrality
measures have to be considered with extreme care, since they can be easily
controlled and even manipulated by a small group of nodes acting in a
coordinated way.

  Networks: Application to Erd\"os-R'enyi and Scale-free Graphs","  We study the statistical behavior under random sequential
renormalization(RSR) of several network models including Erd\"os R'enyi (ER)
graphs, scale-free networks and an annealed model (AM) related to ER graphs. In
RSR the network is locally coarse grained by choosing at each renormalization
step a node at random and joining it to all its neighbors. Compared to previous
(quasi-)parallel renormalization methods [C.Song et.al], RSR allows a more
fine-grained analysis of the renormalization group (RG) flow, and unravels new
features, that were not discussed in the previous analyses. In particular we
find that all networks exhibit a second order transition in their RG flow. This
phase transition is associated with the emergence of a giant hub and can be
viewed as a new variant of percolation, called agglomerative percolation. We
claim that this transition exists also in previous graph renormalization
schemes and explains some of the scaling laws seen there. For critical trees it
happens as N/N0 -> 0 in the limit of large systems (where N0 is the initial
size of the graph and N its size at a given RSR step). In contrast, it happens
at finite N/N0 in sparse ER graphs and in the annealed model, while it happens
for N/N0 -> 1 on scale-free networks. Critical exponents seem to depend on the
type of the graph but not on the average degree and obey usual scaling
relations for percolation phenomena. For the annealed model they agree with the
exponents obtained from a mean-field theory. At late times, the networks
exhibit a star-like structure in agreement with the results of Radicchi et. al.
While degree distributions are of main interest when regarding the scheme as
network renormalization, mass distributions (which are more relevant when
considering 'supernodes' as clusters) are much easier to study using the fast
Newman-Ziff algorithm for percolation, allowing us to obtain very high
statistics.

taxis' traveling displacements in urban areas tend to follow an exponential

well approximated by an exponential distribution. Worth mentioning, analysis of

  sweeping for the Map equation","  The detection of community structure in networks is intimately related to
finding a concise description of the network in terms of its modules. This
notion has been recently exploited by the Map equation formalism (M. Rosvall
and C.T. Bergstrom, PNAS, 105(4), pp.1118--1123, 2008) through an
information-theoretic description of the process of coding inter- and
intra-community transitions of a random walker in the network at stationarity.
However, a thorough study of the relationship between the full Markov dynamics
and the coding mechanism is still lacking. We show here that the original Map
coding scheme, which is both block-averaged and one-step, neglects the internal
structure of the communities and introduces an upper scale, the `field-of-view'
limit, in the communities it can detect. As a consequence, Map is well tuned to
detect clique-like communities but can lead to undesirable overpartitioning
when communities are far from clique-like. We show that a signature of this
behavior is a large compression gap: the Map description length is far from its
ideal limit. To address this issue, we propose a simple dynamic approach that
introduces time explicitly into the Map coding through the analysis of the
weighted adjacency matrix of the time-dependent multistep transition matrix of
the Markov process. The resulting Markov time sweeping induces a dynamical
zooming across scales that can reveal (potentially multiscale) community
structure above the field-of-view limit, with the relevant partitions indicated
by a small compression gap.

matrix of a network and introduced a series of generalized clustering
coefficients based on it. Furthermore we numerically evaluated Milgram
condition proposed by their article in order to explore $q$-$th$ degrees of
separation in scale free networks. In this article, we apply the reformulation
to small world networks and numerically evaluate Milgram condition, especially
the separation number of small world networks and its relation to cycle
structures are discussed. Considering the number of non-zero elements of an
adjacent matrix, the average path length and Milgram condition, we show that
the formalism proposed by us is effective to analyze the six degrees of
separation, especially effective for analyzing the relation between the
separation number and cycle structures in a network.
  By this analysis of small world networks, it proves that a sort of power low
holds between $M_n$, which is a key quantity in Milgram condition, and the
generalized clustering coefficients. This property in small world networks
stands in contrast to that of scale free networks.

organization in biological and social networks, but community detection is
useful only if the communities are significant and not a result of noisy data.
To assess the statistical significance of the network communities, or the
robustness of the detected structure, one approach is to perturb the network
structure by removing links and measure how much the communities change.
However, perturbing sparse networks is challenging because they are inherently
sensitive; they shatter easily if links are removed. Here we propose a simple
method to perturb sparse networks and assess the significance of their
communities. We generate resampled networks by adding extra links based on
local information, then we aggregate the information from multiple resampled
networks to find a coarse-grained description of significant clusters. In
addition to testing our method on benchmark networks, we use our method on the
sparse network of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law, to detect
significant and insignificant areas of law. We use our significance analysis to
draw a map of the ECJ case law network that reveals the relations between the

propose a parsimonious bipartite-cooperation model that reproduces the key
features of mutualistic networks - degree distribution, nestedness and
modularity -- for both ecological networks and socio-economic networks. Our
analysis uses two diverse networks. Mutually-beneficial interactions between
plants and their pollinators, and cooperative economic exchanges between
designers and their contractors. We find that these mutualistic networks share
a key hierarchical ordering of their members, along with an exponential
constraint in the number and type of partners they can cooperate with. We use
our model to show that slight changes in the interaction constraints can
produce either extremely nested or random structures, revealing that these
constraints play a key role in the evolution of mutualistic networks. This
could also encourage a new systematic approach to study the functional and
structural properties of networks. The surprising correspondence across
mutualistic networks suggests their broadly representativeness and their
potential role in the productive organization of exchange systems, both
ecological and social.

previous work illuminating commonalities between ecological and human systems,
we compare the activity patterns of individual financial traders with the
simultaneous activity of other traders---an individual and spontaneous

association of synchronous trading with individual performance and
communication patterns. Analyzing empirical data on day traders'
second-to-second trading and instant messaging, we find that the higher the
traders' synchronous trading, the less likely they lose money at the end of the

eigenspace of a set of matrices. Whilst it has been used successfully in many
areas to track the evolution of systems via their eigenvectors; its application
in network analysis is novel. The key focus in this paper is the use of JD on
matrices of spanning trees of a network. This is especially useful in the case
of real-world contact networks in which a single underlying static graph does
not exist. The average eigenspace may be used to construct a graph which
represents the `average spanning tree' of the network or a representation of
the most common propagation paths. We then examine the distribution of
deviations from the average and find that this distribution in real-world
contact networks is multi-modal; thus indicating several \emph{modes} in the
underlying network. These modes are identified and are found to correspond to
particular times. Thus JD may be used to decompose the behaviour, in time, of
contact networks and produce average static graphs for each time. This may be
viewed as a mixture between a dynamic and static graph approach to contact
network analysis.

are inherently linked to its user basis through a direct channel that has no
equivalent in other sectors; (ii) the growth of the number of users can be
calibrated with standard logistic growth models and allows for reliable
extrapolations of the size of the business at long time horizons. We illustrate
the methodology with a detailed analysis of facebook, one of the biggest of the
social-media giants. There is a clear signature of a change of regime that
occurred in 2010 on the growth of the number of users, from a pure exponential
behavior (a paradigm for unlimited growth) to a logistic function with
asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for growth in competition). We consider three
different scenarios, a base case, a high growth and an extreme growth scenario.
Using a discount factor of 5%, a profit margin of 29% and 3.5 USD of revenues
per user per year yields a value of facebook of 15.3 billion USD in the base
case scenario, 20.2 billion USD in the high growth scenario and 32.9 billion
USD in the extreme growth scenario. According to our methodology, this would
imply that facebook would need to increase its profit per user before the IPO
by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the high growth
scenario and 1.5 to 3 in the extreme growth scenario in order to meet the
current, widespread, high expectations. To prove the wider applicability of our
methodology, the analysis is repeated on Groupon, the well-known

can promote peace. Characterizing the model's success in predicting peace
requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is
recognized as a country of peace, stability and prosperity. This is surprising
because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the
world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is
maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated
coexistence, but rather on well defined topographical and political boundaries
separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries
between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle
(sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups. Where such boundaries
do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population
distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to
inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict.
In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate
linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the
canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between
groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar
analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread
ethnic violence existing political boundaries did not coincide with the
boundaries of distinct groups, but peace prevailed in specific areas where they
did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to
resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the

involves researchers worldwide, regardless of their place of work and
residence. Globalization of science, in this respect, implies that
collaboration among scientists takes place along the lines of common topics and
irrespective of the spatial distances between the collaborators. The networks
of collaborators, termed 'epistemic communities', should thus have a
space-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized
scientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a
novel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration.
The results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that
intra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than
international collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between
collaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when
confined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes
irrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a
globalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local
science clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six
science fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is
independent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.

crowdsource epidemics in real-time. However, Twitter posts ('tweets') are often
ambiguous and reactive to media trends. In order to ground user messages in
epidemic response we focused on tracking reports of self-protective behaviour
such as avoiding public gatherings or increased sanitation as the basis for
further risk analysis. Results: We created guidelines for tagging self
protective behaviour based on Jones and Salath\'e (2009)'s behaviour response
survey. Applying the guidelines to a corpus of 5283 Twitter messages related to
influenza like illness showed a high level of inter-annotator agreement (kappa
0.86). We employed supervised learning using unigrams, bigrams and regular
expressions as features with two supervised classifiers (SVM and Naive Bayes)
to classify tweets into 4 self-reported protective behaviour categories plus a
self-reported diagnosis. In addition to classification performance we report
moderately strong Spearman's Rho correlation by comparing classifier output
against WHO/NREVSS laboratory data for A(H1N1) in the USA during the 2009-2010
influenza season. Conclusions: The study adds to evidence supporting a high
degree of correlation between pre-diagnostic social media signals and
diagnostic influenza case data, pointing the way towards low cost sensor
networks. We believe that the signals we have modelled may be applicable to a
wide range of diseases.

international concern is necessary to help support risk assessment and response
and save lives. Novel event-based methods that use the World Wide Web as a
signal source offer potential to extend health surveillance into areas where
traditional indicator networks are lacking. In this paper we address the issue
of systematically evaluating online health news to support automatic alerting
using daily disease-country counts text mined from real world data using
BioCaster. For 18 data sets produced by BioCaster, we compare 5 aberration
detection algorithms (EARS C2, C3, W2, F-statistic and EWMA) for performance
against expert moderated ProMED-mail postings. Results: We report sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
mean alerts/100 days and F1, at 95% confidence interval (CI) for 287
ProMED-mail postings on 18 outbreaks across 14 countries over a 366 day period.
Results indicate that W2 had the best F1 with a slight benefit for day of week
effect over C2. In drill down analysis we indicate issues arising from the
granular choice of country-level modeling, sudden drops in reporting due to day
of week effects and reporting bias. Automatic alerting has been implemented in
BioCaster available from http://born.nii.ac.jp. Conclusions: Online health news
alerts have the potential to enhance manual analytical methods by increasing
throughput, timeliness and detection rates. Systematic evaluation of health
news aberrations is necessary to push forward our understanding of the complex
relationship between news report volumes and case numbers and to select the
best performing features and algorithms.

  stochastic block models","  Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis, with
applications in many diverse areas. The stochastic block model is a common tool
for model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking
consistency of community detection under the block model have been recently
developed. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes
within a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to
networks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are
common in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to
address this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a
community while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper
we establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection
under the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community
detection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We
show which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well
as compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based
on the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as
a special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that
modularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas
likelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree
correction involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it
is only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly
variable. We illustrate the methods on simulated networks and on a network of
political blogs.

leave a digital trace and affect other people's actions. This has lead to the
emergence of a new data-driven research field: mathematical methods of computer
science, statistical physics and sociometry provide insights on a wide range of
disciplines ranging from social science to human mobility. A recent important
discovery is that query volumes (i.e., the number of requests submitted by
users to search engines on the www) can be used to track and, in some cases, to
anticipate the dynamics of social phenomena. Successful exemples include
unemployment levels, car and home sales, and epidemics spreading. Few recent
works applied this approach to stock prices and market sentiment. However, it
remains unclear if trends in financial markets can be anticipated by the
collective wisdom of on-line users on the web. Here we show that trading
volumes of stocks traded in NASDAQ-100 are correlated with the volumes of
queries related to the same stocks. In particular, query volumes anticipate in
many cases peaks of trading by one day or more. Our analysis is carried out on
a unique dataset of queries, submitted to an important web search engine, which
enable us to investigate also the user behavior. We show that the query volume
dynamics emerges from the collective but seemingly uncoordinated activity of
many users. These findings contribute to the debate on the identification of

science and industrial research. This has led to the construction of a large
variety of graph models, each with their own advantages. The Stochastic
Kronecker Graph (SKG) model has been chosen by the Graph500 steering committee
to create supercomputer benchmarks for graph algorithms. The major reasons for
this are its easy parallelization and ability to mirror real data. Although SKG
is easy to implement, there is little understanding of the properties and
behavior of this model.
  We show that the parallel variant of the edge-configuration model given by
Chung and Lu (referred to as CL) is notably similar to the SKG model. The graph
properties of an SKG are extremely close to those of a CL graph generated with
the appropriate parameters. Indeed, the final probability matrix used by SKG is
almost identical to that of a CL model. This implies that the graph
distribution represented by SKG is almost the same as that given by a CL model.
We also show that when it comes to fitting real data, CL performs as well as
SKG based on empirical studies of graph properties. CL has the added benefit of
a trivially simple fitting procedure and exactly matching the degree
distribution. Our results suggest that users of the SKG model should consider
the CL model because of its similar properties, simpler structure, and ability
to fit a wider range of degree distributions. At the very least, CL is a good
control model to compare against.

the comprehension of self-similar structure in large real-world networks with

that focuses on bundles of words that behave differently from daily
communication routines, and uses original data covering the content of instant
messages among all day traders at a trading firm over a 40-month period.
Analyses show that two word bundles convey traders' understanding of same day

volatility is high, traders' communications are dominated by same day events,
and when volatility is low, communications are dominated by next day events. We
show that the stronger the traders' attention to either same day or next day
events, the higher their collective trading performance. We conclude that
e-communication among traders is a product of mass collaboration over diverse
viewpoints that embodies unique information about their weak or strong
understanding of the market.

information spaces such as domains of the World Wide Web, citation graphs, and

formation depends on the metric distance between vertices. We show, through
theoretical analysis and simulation, that for graphs formed according to the
SPA model it is possible to infer the metric distance between vertices from the
link structure of the graph. Precisely, the estimate is based on the number of
common neighbours of a pair of vertices, a measure known as {\sl co-citation}.
To be able to calculate this estimate, we derive a precise relation between the
number of common neighbours and metric distance. We also analyze the
distribution of {\sl edge lengths}, where the length of an edge is the metric
distance between its end points. We show that this distribution has three
different regimes, and that the tail of this distribution follows a power law.

chemical sensors in active mode consume vast amounts of energy, an optimisation
problem arises in the context of a balance between the energy consumption and
the detection capabilities of such a network. A protocol based on \"dynamic

near optimal capacity design (energy consumption against detection). An

  Regularization","  Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction, with well-documented merits in various applications involving
high-dimensional data, including computer vision, preference measurement, and
bioinformatics. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates
benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify PCA
against outliers. A least-trimmed squares estimator of a low-rank bilinear
factor analysis model is shown closely related to that obtained from an
$\ell_0$-(pseudo)norm-regularized criterion encouraging sparsity in a matrix
explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests robust PCA schemes
based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust
estimators encompassing Huber's optimal M-class as a special case. Outliers are
identified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to controlling
sparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole robustification path of (group)
least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) solutions. Beyond its
neat ties to robust statistics, the developed outlier-aware PCA framework is
versatile to accommodate novel and scalable algorithms to: i) track the
low-rank signal subspace robustly, as new data are acquired in real time; and
ii) determine principal components robustly in (possibly) infinite-dimensional
feature spaces. Synthetic and real data tests corroborate the effectiveness of
the proposed robust PCA schemes, when used to identify aberrant responses in
personality assessment surveys, as well as unveil communities in social
networks, and intruders from video surveillance data.

users, called hidden paid posters, or termed \"Internet water army\" in China,
from the legitimate ones. On the Internet, the paid posters represent a new
type of online job opportunity. They get paid for posting comments and new
threads or articles on different online communities and websites for some
hidden purposes, e.g., to influence the opinion of other people towards certain
social events or business markets. Though an interesting strategy in business
marketing, paid posters may create a significant negative effect on the online
communities, since the information from paid posters is usually not
trustworthy. When two competitive companies hire paid posters to post fake news
or negative comments about each other, normal online users may feel overwhelmed
and find it difficult to put any trust in the information they acquire from the
Internet. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the behavioral pattern of
online paid posters based on real-world trace data. We design and validate a
new detection mechanism, using both non-semantic analysis and semantic
analysis, to identify potential online paid posters. Our test results with
real-world datasets show a very promising performance.

  Analysis of a Dense Network","  We explore one aspect of the structure of a codified legal system at the
national level using a new type of representation to understand the strong or
weak dependencies between the various fields of law. In Part I of this study,
we analyze the graph associated with the network in which each French legal
code is a vertex and an edge is produced between two vertices when a code cites
another code at least one time. We show that this network distinguishes from
many other real networks from a high density, giving it a particular structure
that we call concentrated world and that differentiates a national legal system
(as considered with a resolution at the code level) from small-world graphs
identified in many social networks. Our analysis then shows that a few
communities (groups of highly wired vertices) of codes covering large domains
of regulation are structuring the whole system. Indeed we mainly find a central
group of influent codes, a group of codes related to social issues and a group
of codes dealing with territories and natural resources. The study of this
codified legal system is also of interest in the field of the analysis of real
networks. In particular we examine the impact of the high density on the
structural characteristics of the graph and on the ways communities are
searched for. Finally we provide an original visualization of this graph on an
hemicyle-like plot, this representation being based on a statistical reduction
of dissimilarity measures between vertices. In Part II (a following paper) we
show how the consideration of the weights attributed to each edge in the
network in proportion to the number of citations between two vertices (codes)
allows deepening the analysis of the French legal system.

  Properties from Mobile-Phone Data","  Mobile phones are quickly becoming the primary source for social, behavioral,
and environmental sensing and data collection. Today's smartphones are equipped
with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the
collection of literally dozens of signals related to the phone, its user, and
its environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is
put into mining this raw data for higher level sense-making, such as
understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual
features, predicting outcomes, and so on. In this work we investigate the
properties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile
phones over time. In particular, we look at the dynamic learning process over
time, and how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is
incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do this, we
use the Friends and Family dataset, which contains rich data signals gathered
from the smartphones of 140 adult members of a young-family residential
community for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone
datasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models that predict
social and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data, including
detection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or
not. Then, for this set of diverse learning tasks, we investigate how the
prediction accuracy evolves over time, as new data is collected. Finally, based
on gained insights, we propose a method for advance prediction of the maximal
learning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial
set of measurements. This has practical implications, like informing the design
of mobile data collection campaigns, or evaluating analysis strategies.

enabling effective online viral marketing. Existing studies focus on social
networks with only friendship relations, whereas the foe or enemy relations
that commonly exist in many OSNs, e.g., Epinions and Slashdot, are completely
ignored. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate the influence
diffusion and influence maximization in OSNs with both friend and foe
relations, which are modeled using positive and negative edges on signed

and analyze the dynamics of influence diffusion of two opposite opinions. We
first provide systematic characterization of both short-term and long-term
dynamics of influence diffusion in this model, and illustrate that the steady
state behaviors of the dynamics depend on three types of graph structures,
which we refer to as balanced graphs, anti-balanced graphs, and strictly
unbalanced graphs. We then apply our results to solve the influence
maximization problem and develop efficient algorithms to select initial seeds
of one opinion that maximize either its short-term influence coverage or
long-term steady state influence coverage. Extensive simulation results on both
synthetic and real-world networks, such as Epinions and Slashdot, confirm our
theoretical analysis on influence diffusion dynamics, and demonstrate the

the behavior of individuals, groups and societies. Here, we observe the
formation and evolution of networks by monitoring the addition of all new links
and we analyze quantitatively the tendencies used to create ties in these
evolving online affiliation networks. We first show that an accurate estimation
of these probabilistic tendencies can only be achieved by following the time
evolution of the network. For example, actions that are attributed to the usual
friend of a friend mechanism through a static snapshot of the network are
overestimated by a factor of two. A detailed analysis of the dynamic network
evolution shows that half of those triangles were generated through other
mechanisms, in spite of the characteristic static pattern. We start by
characterizing every single link when the tie was established in the network.
This allows us to describe the probabilistic tendencies of tie formation and
extract sociological conclusions as follows. The tendencies to add new links
differ significantly from what we would expect if they were not affected by the
individuals' structural position in the network, i.e., from random link
formation. We also find significant differences in behavioral traits among
individuals according to their degree of activity, gender, age, popularity and
other attributes. For instance, in the particular datasets analyzed here, we
find that women reciprocate connections three times as much as men and this
difference increases with age. Men tend to connect with the most popular people
more often than women across all ages. On the other hand, triangular ties
tendencies are similar and independent of gender. Our findings can be useful to
build models of realistic social network structures and discover the underlying
laws that govern establishment of ties in evolving social networks.

current approaches typically consider datasets containing crisp relations, so
that standard classification methods can be adopted. However, relations between
objects like similarities and preferences are often expressed in a graded
manner in real-world applications. A general kernel-based framework for
learning relations from data is introduced here. It extends existing approaches
because both crisp and graded relations are considered, and it unifies existing
approaches because different types of graded relations can be modeled,
including symmetric and reciprocal relations. This framework establishes
important links between recent developments in fuzzy set theory and machine
learning. Its usefulness is demonstrated through various experiments on

connected, but understanding their interplay and whether they can help predict
each other has remained an open question. We examine the interface of two
decisive structures forming the backbone of online social media: the graph
structure of social networks - who connects with whom - and the set structure
of topical affiliations - who is interested in what. In studying this
interface, we identify key relationships whereby each of these structures can
be understood in terms of the other. The context for our analysis is Twitter, a
complex social network of both follower relationships and communication
relationships. On Twitter, \"hashtags\" are used to label conversation topics,
and we examine hashtag usage alongside these social structures.
  We find that the hashtags that users adopt can predict their social
relationships, and also that the social relationships between the initial
adopters of a hashtag can predict the future popularity of that hashtag. By
studying weighted social relationships, we observe that while strong
reciprocated ties are the easiest to predict from hashtag structure, they are
also much less useful than weak directed ties for predicting hashtag
popularity. Importantly, we show that computationally simple structural
determinants can provide remarkable performance in both tasks. While our
analyses focus on Twitter, we view our findings as broadly applicable to
topical affiliations and social relationships in a host of diverse contexts,
including the movies people watch, the brands people like, or the locations
people frequent.

  Approach","  A \"community\" in a social network is usually understood to be a group of
nodes more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the network.
This is an important concept in most domains where networks arise: social,
technological, biological, etc. For many years algorithms for finding
communities implicitly assumed communities are nonoverlapping (leading to use
of clustering-based approaches) but there is increasing interest in finding
overlapping communities. A barrier to finding communities is that the solution
concept is often defined in terms of an NP-complete problem such as Clique or
Hierarchical Clustering.
  This paper seeks to initiate a rigorous approach to the problem of finding
overlapping communities, where \"rigorous\" means that we clearly state the
following: (a) the object sought by our algorithm (b) the assumptions about the
underlying network (c) the (worst-case) running time.
  Our assumptions about the network lie between worst-case and average-case. An
average case analysis would require a precise probabilistic model of the
network, on which there is currently no consensus. However, some plausible
assumptions about network parameters can be gleaned from a long body of work in
the sociology community spanning five decades focusing on the study of
individual communities and ego-centric networks. Thus our assumptions are
somewhat \"local\" in nature. Nevertheless they suffice to permit a rigorous
analysis of running time of algorithms that recover global structure.
  Our algorithms use random sampling similar to that in property testing and
algorithms for dense graphs. However, our networks are not necessarily dense
graphs, not even in local neighborhoods.
  Our algorithms explore a local-global relationship between ego-centric and
socio-centric networks that we hope will provide a fruitful framework for
future work both in computer science and sociology.

  interaction","  Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online
communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to
whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The
interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural
language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that
signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles,
status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding
such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge.
  Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between
participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes
the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this
observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination
that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works
consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more \"static\" form
of power based on status differences, and a more \"situational\" form of power in
which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this
framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships
in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments
before the U.S. Supreme Court.

timings of interaction events can be crucial in determining how some dynamic
process mediated by the network unfolds. We have explored the limiting case of
the speed of spreading in the SI model, set up such that an event between an
infectious and susceptible individual always transmits the infection. The speed
of this process sets an upper bound for the speed of any dynamic process that
is mediated through the interaction events of the network. With the help of
temporal networks derived from large scale time-stamped data on mobile phone
calls, we extend earlier results that point out the slowing-down effects of
burstiness and temporal inhomogeneities. In such networks, links are not
permanently active, but dynamic processes are mediated by recurrent events
taking place on the links at specific points in time. We perform a multi-scale
analysis and pinpoint the importance of the timings of event sequences on
individual links, their correlations with neighboring sequences, and the
temporal pathways taken by the network-scale spreading process. This is
achieved by studying empirically and analytically different characteristic
relay times of links, relevant to the respective scales, and a set of temporal
reference models that allow for removing selected time-domain correlations one

opinions of the general public, but it is not a classification system and it is
hard to make sense of. It would be necessary to share a representation of
contexts by all the users to develop a social and collaborative matching. The
solution could be to help the users to choose proper tags thanks to a dynamical
driven system of folksonomy that could evolve during the time. This paper uses
a cluster analysis to measure a new concept of a structure called
\"Folksodriven\", which consists of tags, source and time. Many approaches
include in their goals the use of folksonomy that could evolve during time to
evaluate characteristics. This paper describes an alternative where the goal is
to develop a weighted network of tags where link strengths are based on the
frequencies of tag co-occurrence, and studied the weight distributions and
connectivity correlations among nodes in this network. The paper proposes and
analyzes the network structure of the Folksodriven tags thought as folksonomy
tags suggestions for the user on a dataset built on chosen websites. It is
observed that the hypergraphs of the Folksodriven are highly connected and that
the relative path lengths are relatively low, facilitating thus the
serendipitous discovery of interesting contents for the users. Then its
characteristics, Clustering Coefficient, is compared with random networks. The
goal of this paper is a useful analysis of the use of folksonomies on some well
known and extensive web sites with real user involvement. The advantages of the
new tagging method using folksonomy are on a new interesting method to be
employed by a knowledge management system.

A well-accepted way to judge the validity is to compare the modeling results
with real networks subject to several structural features. Even for a specific
real network, we cannot fairly evaluate the goodness of different models since
there are too many structural features while there is no criterion to select
and assign weights on them. Motivated by the studies on link prediction
algorithms, we propose a unified method to evaluate the network models via the
comparison of the likelihoods of the currently observed network driven by
different models, with an assumption that the higher the likelihood is, the
better the model is. We test our method on the real Internet at the Autonomous
System (AS) level, and the results suggest that the Generalized Linear
Preferential (GLP) model outperforms the Tel Aviv Network Generator (Tang),
while both two models are better than the Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) and
Erd\\"os-R\'enyi (ER) models. Our method can be further applied in determining
the optimal values of parameters that correspond to the maximal likelihood.
Experiment indicates that the parameters obtained by our method can better
capture the characters of newly-added nodes and links in the AS-level Internet

global population. One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition
and the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported
expenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims' monetary losses due to
cyber crime.
  This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network
built on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We
collected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global
social network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as
cheaters. We also collected in-game interaction data of over 10 thousand
players from a popular multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are
well embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is
largely undistinguishable from that of fair players. We observe that the
cheating behavior appears to spread through a social mechanism: the presence
and the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the
likelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also, we observe that there
is a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters are
likely to switch to more restrictive privacy settings once they are tagged and
they lose more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the number
of cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population
density, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community.
  This analysis can ultimately inform the design of mechanisms to deal with
anti-social behavior (e.g., spamming, automated collection of data) in generic
online social networks.

shared equally between the particle joining the cluster and the particles that
are already members of the cluster. Power-law probability distributions of

public. This event is following other recent IPOs in the world of social
networking companies, such as Groupon, Linkedin or Pandora to cite a few. With
a valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga has
become the biggest web IPO since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social
networking companies, and in particular Zynga, brings up the question whether
or not they are overvalued. The common denominator of all these IPOs is that a
lot of estimates about their valuation have been circulating, without any
specifics given about the methodology or assumptions used to obtain those
numbers. To bring more substance to the debate, we propose a two-tiered
approach. First, we introduce a new model to forecast the global user base of
Zynga, based on the analysis of the individual dynamics of its major games.
Next, we model the revenues per user using a logistic growth function, a
standard model for growth in competition. This leads to bracket the valuation
of Zynga using three different scenarios (base one, optimistic and very
optimistic): 4.17 billion USD in the base case, 5.16 billion in the high growth
and 7.02 billion in the extreme growth scenario respectively. Thus, only the
unlikely extreme growth scenario could potentially justify today's 6.6 billion
USD valuation of Zynga. This suggests that Zynga at its IPO has been
overpriced.

separated into discrete groups, and the probability of an edge existing between
two vertices is determined solely by their group membership. In this paper, we
derive expressions for the entropy of stochastic blockmodel ensembles. We
consider several ensemble variants, including the traditional model as well as
the newly introduced degree-corrected version [Karrer et al. Phys. Rev. E 83,
016107 (2011)], which imposes a degree sequence on the vertices, in addition to
the block structure. The imposed degree sequence is implemented both as \"soft\"
constraints, where only the expected degrees are imposed, and as \"hard\"
constraints, where they are required to be the same on all samples of the
ensemble. We also consider generalizations to multigraphs and directed graphs.
We illustrate one of many applications of this measure by directly deriving a
log-likelihood function from the entropy expression, and using it to infer
latent block structure in observed data. Due to the general nature of the
ensembles considered, the method works well for ensembles with intrinsic degree
correlations (i.e. with entropic origin) as well as extrinsic degree
correlations, which go beyond the block structure.

paper we quantify how topological properties of word co-occurrence networks and
intermittency (or burstiness) in word distribution depend on the style of
authors. Our database contains 40 books from 8 authors who lived in the 19th
and 20th centuries, for which the following network measurements were obtained:
clustering coefficient, average shortest path lengths, and betweenness. We
found that the two factors with stronger dependency on the authors were the
skewness in the distribution of word intermittency and the average shortest
paths. Other factors such as the betweeness and the Zipf's law exponent show
only weak dependency on authorship. Also assessed was the contribution from
each measurement to authorship recognition using three machine learning
methods. The best performance was a ca. 65 % accuracy upon combining complex
network and intermittency features with the nearest neighbor algorithm. From a
detailed analysis of the interdependence of the various metrics it is concluded
that the methods used here are complementary for providing short- and
long-scale perspectives of texts, which are useful for applications such as
identification of topical words and information retrieval.

combination weights that are used by the nodes to fuse information from their
neighbors play a critical role in influencing the adaptation and tracking
abilities of the network. This paper first investigates the mean-square
performance of general adaptive diffusion algorithms in the presence of various
sources of imperfect information exchanges, quantization errors, and model
non-stationarities. Among other results, the analysis reveals that link noise
over the regression data modifies the dynamics of the network evolution in a
distinct way, and leads to biased estimates in steady-state. The analysis also
reveals how the network mean-square performance is dependent on the combination
weights. We use these observations to show how the combination weights can be
optimized and adapted. Simulation results illustrate the theoretical findings

innovations for improved welfare and economic growth is briefly described from
a historical point of view. Next, three approaches are discussed for modeling

illustrated through their corresponding population dynamics and epidemic models
relative to the spreading of ideas, knowledge and innovations. The
deterministic dynamical models are considered to be appropriate for analyzing
the evolution of large and small societal, scientific and technological systems
when the influence of fluctuations is insignificant. Stochastic models are
appropriate when the system of interest is small but when the fluctuations
become significant for its evolution. Finally statistical approaches and models
based on the laws and distributions of Lotka, Bradford, Yule, Zipf-Mandelbrot,

  modularity","  Much effort has gone into understanding the modular nature of complex
networks. Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are typically
considered to be densely interconnected groups of nodes that are only sparsely
connected to other groups in the network. Discovering high quality communities
is a difficult and important problem in a number of areas. The most popular
approach is the objective function known as modularity, used both to discover
communities and to measure their strength. To understand the modular structure
of networks it is then crucial to know how such functions evaluate different
topologies, what features they account for, and what implicit assumptions they
may make. We show that trees and treelike networks can have unexpectedly and
often arbitrarily high values of modularity. This is surprising since trees are
maximally sparse connected graphs and are not typically considered to possess
modular structure, yet the nonlocal null model used by modularity assigns low
probabilities, and thus high significance, to the densities of these sparse
tree communities. We further study the practical performance of popular methods
on model trees and on a genealogical data set and find that the discovered
communities also have very high modularity, often approaching its maximum
value. Statistical tests reveal the communities in trees to be significant, in
contrast with known results for partitions of sparse, random graphs.

Power Grid and made an initial analysis of the economic impact topological
properties have on decentralized energy trading. In this paper, we go one step
further and investigate how different networks topologies and growth models
facilitate the emergence of a decentralized market. In particular, we show how
the connectivity plays an important role in improving the properties of
reliability and path-cost reduction. From the economic point of view, we
estimate how the topological evolutions facilitate local electricity
distribution, taking into account the main cost ingredient required for
increasing network connectivity, i.e., the price of cabling.

feedback, without exogenous driving. The World Trade Network (WTN) is one of
the few empirically well documented examples of self-organizing networks: its
topology strongly depends on the GDP of world countries, which in turn depends
on the structure of trade. Therefore, understanding which are the key
topological properties of the WTN that deviate from randomness provides direct
empirical information about the structural effects of self-organization. Here,
using an analytical pattern-detection method that we have recently proposed, we
study the occurrence of triadic \"motifs\" (subgraphs of three vertices) in the
WTN between 1950 and 2000. We find that, unlike other properties, motifs are
not explained by only the in- and out-degree sequences. By contrast, they are
completely explained if also the numbers of reciprocal edges are taken into
account. This implies that the self-organization process underlying the
evolution of the WTN is almost completely encoded into the dyadic structure,
which strongly depends on reciprocity.

about the actual system. Variants of breadth-first search (BFS) sampling, which
are based on epidemic processes, are widely used. Although it is well
established that BFS sampling fails, in most cases, to capture the
IN-component(s) of directed networks, a description of the effects of BFS
sampling on other topological properties are all but absent from the
literature. To systematically study the effects of sampling biases on directed
networks, we compare BFS sampling to random sampling on complete large-scale
directed networks. We present new results and a thorough analysis of the
topological properties of seven different complete directed networks (prior to
sampling), including three versions of Wikipedia, three different sources of
sampled World Wide Web data, and an Internet-based social network. We detail
the differences that sampling method and coverage can make to the structural
properties of sampled versions of these seven networks. Most notably, we find
that sampling method and coverage affect both the bow-tie structure, as well as
the number and structure of strongly connected components in sampled networks.
In addition, at low sampling coverage (i.e. less than 40%), the values of
average degree, variance of out-degree, degree auto-correlation, and link
reciprocity are overestimated by 30% or more in BFS-sampled networks, and only
attain values within 10% of the corresponding values in the complete networks
when sampling coverage is in excess of 65%. These results may cause us to
rethink what we know about the structure, function, and evolution of real-world
directed networks.

Its empirical characterization at the worldwide scale is represented by the
World Trade Web (WTW), the network built upon the trade relationships between
the different countries. Several scientific studies have focused on the
structural characterization of this network, as well as its dynamical
properties, since we have registry of the structure of the network at different
times in history. In this paper we study an abstract scenario for the
development of global crises on top of the structure of connections of the WTW.
Assuming a cyclic dynamics of national economies and the interaction of
different countries according to the import-export balances, we are able to
investigate, using a simple model of pulse-coupled oscillators, the
synchronization phenomenon of crises at the worldwide scale. We focus on the
level of synchronization measured by an order parameter at two different
scales, one for the global system and another one for the mesoscales defined
through the topology. We use the WTW network structure to simulate a network of
Integrate-and-Fire oscillators for six different snapshots between years 1950
and 2000. The results reinforce the idea that globalization accelerates the
global synchronization process, and the analysis at a mesoscopic level shows
that this synchronization is different before and after globalization periods:
after globalization, the effect of communities is almost inexistent.

essential to confront the problem of the topology-functionality relationship.
Recently, several authors have worked on the limit of resolution that different
community detection algorithms have, making impossible the detection of natural
modules when very different topological scales coexist in the network. Existing
multiresolution methods are not the panacea for solving the problem in extreme
situations, and also fail. Here, we present a new hierarchical multiresolution
scheme that works even when the network decomposition is very close to the
resolution limit. The idea is to split the multiresolution method for optimal
subgraphs of the network, focusing the analysis on each part independently. We
also propose a new algorithm to speed up the computational cost of screening
the mesoscale looking for the resolution parameter that best splits every
subgraph. The hierarchical algorithm is able to solve a difficult benchmark
proposed in [Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2011], encouraging the further analysis
of hierarchical methods based on the modularity quality function.

  Structure in Networks","  To find interesting structure in networks, community detection algorithms
have to take into account not only the network topology, but also dynamics of
interactions between nodes. We investigate this claim using the paradigm of
synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators. As the network evolves to
a global steady state, nodes belonging to the same community synchronize faster
than nodes belonging to different communities. Traditionally, nodes in network
synchronization models are coupled via one-to-one, or conservative
interactions. However, social interactions are often one-to-many, as for
example, in social media, where users broadcast messages to all their
followers. We formulate a novel model of synchronization in a network of
coupled oscillators in which the oscillators are coupled via one-to-many, or
non-conservative interactions. We study the dynamics of different interaction
models and contrast their spectral properties. To find multi-scale community
structure in a network of interacting nodes, we define a similarity function
that measures the degree to which nodes are synchronized and use it to
hierarchically cluster nodes. We study real-world social networks, including
networks of two social media providers. To evaluate the quality of the
discovered communities in a social media network we propose a community quality
metric based on user activity. We find that conservative and non-conservative
interaction models lead to dramatically different views of community structure
even within the same network. Our work offers a novel mathematical framework
for exploring the relationship between network structure, topology and
dynamics.

these systems are more vulnerable to attacks since node failures in one network
may result in (due to the interdependence) failures in the other network,
causing a cascade of failures that would potentially lead to the collapse of
the entire infrastructure. The robustness of interdependent systems against
this sort of catastrophic failure hinges heavily on the allocation of the
(interconnecting) links that connect nodes in one network to nodes in the other
network. In this paper, we characterize the optimum inter-link allocation
strategy against random attacks in the case where the topology of each
individual network is unknown. In particular, we analyze the \"regular\"
allocation strategy that allots exactly the same number of bi-directional
inter-network links to all nodes in the system. We show, both analytically and
experimentally, that this strategy yields better performance (from a network
resilience perspective) compared to all possible strategies, including
strategies using random allocation, unidirectional inter-links, etc.

bipartization, i.e., the directed network is mapped onto a bipartite undirected
network with twice as many nodes in order to obtain a network with a symmetric
adjacency matrix. We explicitly determine the exponential of this adjacency
matrix in terms of the adjacency matrix of the original, directed network, and
we give an interpretation of centrality and communicability in this new

exponential method for computing hubs and authorities is compared to the well
known HITS algorithm, both on small artificial examples and on more realistic
real-world networks. A few other ranking algorithms are also discussed and
compared with our technique. The use of Gaussian quadrature rules for

several limitations. Recently, general-purpose web search engines have also
been utilized to collect information about social networks. Here we
reconstructed, using web search engines, a network representing the relatedness

Relatedness between researchers and research topics was characterized by
visibility boost-increase of a researcher's visibility by focusing on a
particular topic. It was observed that researchers who had high visibility
boosts by the same research topic tended to be close to each other in their
network. We calculated correlations between visibility boosts by research
topics and researchers' interdisciplinarity at individual level (diversity of
topics related to the researcher) and at social level (his/her centrality in
the researchers' network). We found that visibility boosts by certain research
topics were positively correlated with researchers' individual-level
interdisciplinarity despite their negative correlations with the general
popularity of researchers. It was also found that visibility boosts by
network-related topics had positive correlations with researchers' social-level
interdisciplinarity. Research topics' correlations with researchers'
individual- and social-level interdisciplinarities were found to be nearly
independent from each other. These findings suggest that the notion of

practices, four examples show the barriers that can be encountered today. This
paper aims defining the key elements that enhance collaborative networks. The
analysis of best practices from collaborative environments enables the design
of high standard information systems and initiate knowledge ecosystems. A

importance of web pages. Considering how deeply rooted Google's PR algorithm is
to gathering relevant information or to the success of modern businesses, the
question of rank-stability and choice of the damping factor (a parameter in the
algorithm) is clearly important. We investigate PR as a function of the damping
factor d on a network obtained from a domain of the World Wide Web, finding
that rank-reversal happens frequently over a broad range of PR (and of d). We
use three different correlation measures, Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall, to
study rank-reversal as d changes, and show that the correlation of PR vectors
drops rapidly as d changes from its frequently cited value, $d_0=0.85$.
Rank-reversal is also observed by measuring the Spearman and Kendall rank
correlation, which evaluate relative ranks rather than absolute PR.
Rank-reversal happens not only in directed networks containing rank-sinks but
also in a single strongly connected component, which by definition does not
contain any sinks. We relate rank-reversals to rank-pockets and bottlenecks in
the directed network structure. For the network studied, the relative rank is
more stable by our measures around $d=0.65$ than at $d=d_0$.

individuals or objects in the absence of external identification or tagging. We
address this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of
communities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their
members. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set
of elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other
elements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping)
communities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community
collectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these
communities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are
\"self-determined\" or \"self-certified\" by its members.
  We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined
communities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a
polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we
obtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that
can find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community.
  Social networks fit particularly naturally within the affinity system
framework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively
sparse yet rich information from social networks, our analysis then yields a
set of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in
social networks. In the context of social networks we also connect our analysis
with results about $(\alpha,\beta)$-clusters introduced by Mishra, Schreiber,
Stanton, and Tarjan \cite{msst}. In contrast with the polynomial bound we prove
on the number of communities in the affinity system model, we show that there
exists a family of networks with superpolynomial number of
$(\alpha,\beta)$-clusters.

Moreover, the way particle interactions are evaluated depends on a parameter
that controls the shape of the underlying gaussian model. In principle,
different clusters of proximal particles can be identified, according to the
value adopted for the parameter. This degree of freedom in gaussian potentials
has been introduced with the goal of allowing multiresolution analysis. In
particular, upon the adoption of a standard community detection algorithm,
multiresolution analysis is put into practice by repeatedly running the
algorithm on a set of adjacency matrices, each dependent on a specific value of
the parameter that controls the shape of gaussian potentials. As a result,
different partitioning schemas are obtained on the given dataset, so that the

allowed to identify a repetitive pattern, which appear to be useful in the task
of identifying optimal solutions while analysing other synthetic and real

including the ultra-slow spatial growth of individual mobility. However, the
detailed substructures and spatiotemporal flows of mobility - the sets and
sequences of visited locations - have not been well studied. We show that
individual mobility is dominated by small groups of frequently visited,
dynamically close locations, forming primary \"habitats\" capturing typical daily
activity, along with subsidiary habitats representing additional travel. These
habitats do not correspond to typical contexts such as home or work. The
temporal evolution of mobility within habitats, which constitutes most motion,
is universal across habitats and exhibits scaling patterns both distinct from
all previous observations and unpredicted by current models. The delay to enter
subsidiary habitats is a primary factor in the spatiotemporal growth of human
travel. Interestingly, habitats correlate with non-mobility dynamics such as
communication activity, implying that habitats may influence processes such as
information spreading and revealing new connections between human mobility and
social networks.

  Network","  Much of social network analysis is - implicitly or explicitly - predicated on
the assumption that individuals tend to be more similar to their friends than
to strangers. Thus, an observed social network provides a noisy signal about
the latent underlying \"social space:\" the way in which individuals are similar
or dissimilar. Many research questions frequently addressed via social network
analysis are in reality questions about this social space, raising the question
of inverting the process: Given a social network, how accurately can we
reconstruct the social structure of similarities and dissimilarities?
  We begin to address this problem formally. Observed social networks are
usually multiplex, in the sense that they reflect (dis)similarities in several
different \"categories,\" such as geographical proximity, kinship, or similarity
of professions/hobbies. We assume that each such category is characterized by a
latent metric capturing (dis)similarities in this category. Each category gives
rise to a separate social network: a random graph parameterized by this metric.
For a concrete model, we consider Kleinberg's small world model and some
variations thereof. The observed social network is the unlabeled union of these
graphs, i.e., the presence or absence of edges can be observed, but not their
origins. Our main result is an algorithm which reconstructs each metric with
provably low distortion.

motivated by discovery processes in large-scale distributed networks like
peer-to-peer or social networks.
  A well-studied problem in peer-to-peer networks is the resource discovery
problem. There, the goal for nodes (hosts with IP addresses) is to discover the
IP addresses of all other hosts. In social networks, nodes (people) discover
new nodes through exchanging contacts with their neighbors (friends). In both
cases the discovery of new nodes changes the underlying network - new edges are
added to the network - and the process continues in the changed network.
Rigorously analyzing such dynamic (stochastic) processes with a continuously
self-changing topology remains a challenging problem with obvious applications.
  This paper studies and analyzes two natural gossip-based discovery processes.
In the push process, each node repeatedly chooses two random neighbors and puts
them in contact (i.e., \"pushes\" their mutual information to each other). In the
pull discovery process, each node repeatedly requests or \"pulls\" a random
contact from a random neighbor. Both processes are lightweight, local, and
naturally robust due to their randomization.
  Our main result is an almost-tight analysis of the time taken for these two
randomized processes to converge. We show that in any undirected n-node graph
both processes take O(n log^2 n) rounds to connect every node to all other
nodes with high probability, whereas Omega(n log n) is a lower bound. In the
directed case we give an O(n^2 log n) upper bound and an Omega(n^2) lower bound
for strongly connected directed graphs. A key technical challenge that we
overcome is the analysis of a randomized process that itself results in a
constantly changing network which leads to complicated dependencies in every
round.

potentially fake sources. Although we focus on a specific question, our work
provides broad insights into both consumer and merchant behavior within the

network analysis is, given an arbitrary approximation factor $c>1$, to output a
set $S$ of nodes that with high probability contains all nodes of PageRank at
least $\Delta$, and no node of PageRank smaller than $\Delta/c$. We call this
problem {\sc SignificantPageRanks}. We develop a nearly optimal, local
algorithm for the problem with runtime complexity $\tilde{O}(n/\Delta)$ on
networks with $n$ nodes. We show that any algorithm for solving this problem
must have runtime of ${\Omega}(n/\Delta)$, rendering our algorithm optimal up
to logarithmic factors.
  Our algorithm comes with two main technical contributions. The first is a
multi-scale sampling scheme for a basic matrix problem that could be of
interest on its own. In the abstract matrix problem it is assumed that one can
access an unknown {\em right-stochastic matrix} by querying its rows, where the
cost of a query and the accuracy of the answers depend on a precision parameter
$\epsilon$. At a cost propositional to $1/\epsilon$, the query will return a
list of $O(1/\epsilon)$ entries and their indices that provide an
$\epsilon$-precision approximation of the row. Our task is to find a set that
contains all columns whose sum is at least $\Delta$, and omits any column whose
sum is less than $\Delta/c$. Our multi-scale sampling scheme solves this
problem with cost $\tilde{O}(n/\Delta)$, while traditional sampling algorithms
would take time $\Theta((n/\Delta)^2)$.
  Our second main technical contribution is a new local algorithm for
approximating personalized PageRank, which is more robust than the earlier ones
developed in \cite{JehW03,AndersenCL06} and is highly efficient particularly
for networks with large in-degrees or out-degrees. Together with our multiscale
sampling scheme we are able to optimally solve the {\sc SignificantPageRanks}
problem.

  real-world networks","  Complex networks of real-world systems are believed to be controlled by
common phenomena, producing structures far from regular or random. Clustering,
community structure and assortative mixing by degree are perhaps among most
prominent examples of the latter. Although generally accepted for social
networks, these properties only partially explain the structure of other
networks. We first show that degree-corrected clustering is in contrast to
standard definition highly assortative. Yet interesting on its own, we further
note that non-social networks contain connected regions with very low
clustering. Hence, the structure of real-world networks is beyond communities.
We here investigate the concept of functional modules---groups of regularly
equivalent nodes---and show that such structures could explain for the
properties observed in non-social networks. Real-world networks might be
composed of functional modules that are overlaid by communities. We support the
latter by proposing a simple network model that generates scale-free
small-world networks with tunable clustering and degree mixing. Model has a
natural interpretation in many real-world networks, while it also gives
insights into an adequate community extraction framework. We also present an
algorithm for detection of arbitrary structural modules without any prior
knowledge. Algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art, while
application to real-world networks reveals well supported composites of
different structural modules that are consistent with the underlying systems.
Clear functional modules are identified in all types of networks including

  graphs","  Markov chains are a convenient means of generating realizations of networks,
since they require little more than a procedure for rewiring edges. If a
rewiring procedure exists for generating new graphs with specified statistical
properties, then a Markov chain sampler can generate an ensemble of graphs with
prescribed characteristics. However, successive graphs in a Markov chain cannot
be used when one desires independent draws from the distribution of graphs; the
realizations are correlated. Consequently, one runs a Markov chain for N
iterations before accepting the realization as an independent sample. In this
work, we devise two methods for calculating N. They are both based on the
binary \"time-series\" denoting the occurrence/non-occurrence of edge (u, v)
between vertices u and v in the Markov chain of graphs generated by the
sampler. They differ in their underlying assumptions. We test them on the
generation of graphs with a prescribed joint degree distribution. We find the N
proportional |E|, where |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The two
methods are compared by sampling on real, sparse graphs with 10^3 - 10^4
vertices.

  Interventions","  Malware spread among websites and between websites and clients is an
increasing problem. Search engines play an important role in directing users to
websites and are a natural control point for intervening, using mechanisms such
as blacklisting. The paper presents a simple Markov model of malware spread
through large populations of websites and studies the effect of two
interventions that might be deployed by a search provider: blacklisting
infected web pages by removing them from search results entirely and a
generalization of blacklisting, called depreferencing, in which a website's
ranking is decreased by a fixed percentage each time period the site remains
infected. We analyze and study the trade-offs between infection exposure and
traffic loss due to false positives (the cost to a website that is incorrectly
blacklisted) for different interventions. As expected, we find that
interventions are most effective when websites are slow to remove infections.
Surprisingly, we also find that low infection or recovery rates can increase
traffic loss due to false positives. Our analysis also shows that heavy-tailed
distributions of website popularity, as documented in many studies, leads to
high sample variance of all measured outcomes. These result implies that it
will be difficult to determine empirically whether certain website
interventions are effective, and it suggests that theoretical models such as
the one described in this paper have an important role to play in improving web
security.

outlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually
intensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time

methods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing
techniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs
thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will
improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to
correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space
were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable
threshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding,
a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures (\"pixelarity\")
in an image after thresholding. The metric indicates how cleanly a threshold
segments background and foreground elements and hence provides a good measure
of the quality of a given threshold. This research results in successful
extractions in roughly 93% of images, and significantly reduces user-input

topologies of the Internet. Although Internet topology data have been brought
to the attention of a wide and somewhat diverse audience of scholars, so far
they have been overlooked by economists. In this paper, we suggest that such
data could be effectively treated as a proxy to characterize the size of the
\"digital economy\" at country level and outsourcing: thus, we analyse the
topological structure of the network of trade in digital services (trade in
bits) and compare it with that of the more traditional flow of manufactured
goods across countries. To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with
different characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of
connections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution.
Original data are thus filtered by means of different thresholds, so that we
only focus on the strongest links, i.e., statistically significant links. We
find that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network
structure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than
total trade. Lastly, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the
network of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital
services.

networks that has both a given degree distribution and a tunable clustering
coefficient. We consider two types of growth processes on these graphs:
diffusion and symmetric threshold model. The diffusion process is inspired from
epidemic models. It is characterized by an infection probability, each neighbor
transmitting the epidemic independently. In the symmetric threshold process,
the interactions are still local but the propagation rule is governed by a
threshold (that might vary among the different nodes). An interesting example
of symmetric threshold process is the contagion process, which is inspired by a
simple coordination game played on the network. Both types of processes have
been used to model spread of new ideas, technologies, viruses or worms and
results have been obtained for random graphs with no clustering. In this paper,
we are able to analyze the impact of clustering on the growth processes. While
clustering inhibits the diffusion process, its impact for the contagion process
is more subtle and depends on the connectivity of the graph: in a low
connectivity regime, clustering also inhibits the contagion, while in a high
connectivity regime, clustering favors the appearance of global cascades but
reduces their size.
  For both diffusion and symmetric threshold models, we characterize conditions
under which global cascades are possible and compute their size explicitly, as
a function of the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient. Our
results are applied to regular or power-law graphs with exponential cutoff and
shed new light on the impact of clustering.

on average the first ratings that businesses receive overestimate their
eventual reputation. In particular, the first review that a business receives
in our dataset averages 4.1 stars, while the 20th review averages just 3.69
stars. This significant warm-start bias which may be attributed to the limited
exposure of a business in its first steps may mask analysis performed on
ratings and reputational ramifications. Therefore, we study techniques to
identify and correct for this bias. Further, we perform a case study to explore
the effect of a Groupon deal on the merchant's subsequent ratings and show both
that previous research has overestimated Groupon's effect to merchants'
reputation and that average ratings anticorrelate with the number of reviews
received. Our analysis points to the importance of identifying and removing

  of obesity, diabetes and cancer","  Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, obesity and certain forms of cancer
have been increasing in many countries at alarming levels. A difficulty in the
conception of policies to reverse these trends is the identification of the
drivers behind the global epidemics. Here, we implement a spatial spreading
analysis to investigate whether diabetes, obesity and cancer show spatial
correlations revealing the effect of collective and global factors acting above
individual choices. We adapt a theoretical framework for critical physical
systems displaying collective behavior to decipher the laws of spatial
spreading of diseases. We find a regularity in the spatial fluctuations of
their prevalence revealed by a pattern of scale-free long-range correlations.
The fluctuations are anomalous, deviating in a fundamental way from the weaker
correlations found in the underlying population distribution. This collective
behavior indicates that the spreading dynamics of obesity, diabetes and some
forms of cancer like lung cancer are analogous to a critical point of
fluctuations, just as a physical system in a second-order phase transition.
According to this notion, individual interactions and habits may have
negligible influence in shaping the global patterns of spreading. Thus, obesity
turns out to be a global problem where local details are of little importance.
Interestingly, we find the same critical fluctuations in obesity and diabetes,
and in the activities of economic sectors associated with food production such
as supermarkets, food and beverage stores--- which cluster in a different
universality class than other generic sectors of the economy. These results
motivate future interventions to investigate the causality of this relation
providing guidance for the implementation of preventive health policies.

transmitters adjust their powers to maintain a target SINR level in the
presence of interference. In this paper, we analyze the optimal power vector
that achieves this target in large, random networks obtained by \"erasing\" a
finite fraction of nodes from a regular lattice of transmitter-receiver pairs.
We show that this problem is equivalent to the so-called Anderson model of
electron motion in dirty metals which has been used extensively in the analysis
of diffusion in random environments. A standard approximation to this model is
the so-called coherent potential approximation (CPA) method which we apply to
evaluate the first and second order intra-sample statistics of the optimal
power vector in one- and two-dimensional systems. This approach is equivalent
to traditional techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, but
while generally accurate (and in agreement with numerical simulations), it
fails to fully describe the system: in particular, results obtained in this way
fail to predict when power control becomes infeasible. In this regard, we find
that the infinite system is always unstable beyond a certain value of the
target SINR, but any finite system only has a small probability of becoming
unstable. This instability probability is proportional to the tails of the
eigenvalue distribution of the system which are calculated to exponential
accuracy using methodologies developed within the Anderson model and its ties
with random walks in random media. Finally, using these techniques, we also
calculate the tails of the system's power distribution under power control and
the rate of convergence of the Foschini-Miljanic power control algorithm in the

  metapopulation networks","  We propose an efficient strategy to suppress epidemic explosion in
heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a
subpopulation with any number of individuals and is assigned a curing rate that
is proportional to $k^{\alpha}$ with $k$ the node degree and $\alpha$ an
adjustable parameter. We have performed stochastic simulations of the dynamical
reaction-diffusion processes associated with the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model in scale-free networks. We found that
the epidemic threshold reaches a maximum when the exponent $\alpha$ is tuned to
be $\alpha_{opt}\simeq 1.3$. This nontrivial phenomenon is robust to the change
of the network size and the average degree. In addition, we have carried out a
mean field analysis to further validate our scheme, which also demonstrates
that epidemic explosion follows different routes for $\alpha$ larger or less
than $\alpha_{opt}$. Our work suggests that in order to effectively suppress
epidemic spreading on heterogeneous complex networks, subpopulations with
higher degrees should be allocated more resources than just being linearly
dependent on the degree $k$.

sociologists for quite some time. In many of the models, a group of people in a
social network, each holding a numerical opinion, arrive at a shared opinion
through repeated averaging with their neighbors in the network. Motivated by
the observation that consensus is rarely reached in real opinion dynamics, we
study a related sociological model in which individuals' intrinsic beliefs
counterbalance the averaging process and yield a diversity of opinions.
  By interpreting the repeated averaging as best-response dynamics in an
underlying game with natural payoffs, and the limit of the process as an
equilibrium, we are able to study the cost of disagreement in these models
relative to a social optimum. We provide a tight bound on the cost at
equilibrium relative to the optimum; our analysis draws a connection between
these agreement models and extremal problems that lead to generalized
eigenvalues. We also consider a natural network design problem in this setting:
which links can we add to the underlying network to reduce the cost of
disagreement at equilibrium?

  Networks","  Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics and
machine vision. However Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is
extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the
calculation of an intractable normalising constant. This problem has received
much attention, but very little of this has focussed on the important practical
case where the data consists of noisy or incomplete observations of the
underlying hidden structure. This paper specifically addresses this problem,
comparing two alternative methodologies. In the first of these approaches
particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu et al., 2010) is used to efficiently
explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray et
al., 2006) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalising constant
(a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution in
found in a supplementary appendix online). This approach is compared with
approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al., 1999). Applications to
estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from
noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the paper targets an
approximation to the true posterior due to the use of MCMC to simulate from the
latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly in general.
The supplementary appendix also describes the nature of the resulting
approximation.

obvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation
systems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of
time. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage
caused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional
goals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of
design priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,
complexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due
to technological development, climate change, and activities in the political
arena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an
unprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse
events on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted
at the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the
development of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis
of the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The
current paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the
computational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology
with multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with
multiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and
space expenses of computations are also discussed.

cumulatively, this study traces the evolution of the \"here and now\" using
fixed-duration sliding windows. The analysis uses a suite of common network
diagnostics, including the distributions of degrees, distances, and clustering,
to track network structure. Several random models that call these diagnostics
as parameters help tease them apart as factors from the values of others. Some
behaviors are consistent over the entire interval, but most diagnostics
indicate that the network's structural evolution is dominated by occasional
dramatic shifts in otherwise steady trends. These behaviors are not distributed
evenly across the network; stark differences in evolution can be observed
between two major subnetworks, loosely thought of as \"pure\" and \"applied\",
which approximately partition the aggregate. The paper characterizes two major
events along the mathematics network trajectory and discusses possible
explanatory factors.

went public. This event followed other recent IPOs in the world of social
networking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a
valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became
one of the biggest web IPOs since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social
networking companies raises the question whether they are overvalued. Indeed,
during the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its
market capitalization going from 5.6 to 10.2 billion USD, hinting at a possible
irrational behavior from the market. To bring substance to the debate, we
propose a two-tiered approach to compute the intrinsic value of Zynga. First,
we introduce a new model to forecast its user base, based on the individual
dynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a
logistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us
to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and
4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario
respectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO.
Finally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the
arXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this
herding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important
coming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th,
2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). On
the long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease

can be of $r$ different types, and for a given content (e.g., rumor, product,
political view), each link type is associated with a content dependent
parameter $c_i$ in $[0,\infty]$ that measures the relative bias type-$i$ links
have in spreading this content. In this setting, we propose a linear threshold
model of contagion where nodes switch state if their \"perceived\" proportion of
active neighbors exceeds a threshold \tau. Namely, a node connected to $m_i$
active neighbors and $k_i-m_i$ inactive neighbors via type-$i$ links will turn
active if $\sum{c_i m_i}/\sum{c_i k_i}$ exceeds its threshold \tau. Under this
model, we obtain the condition, probability and expected size of global
spreading events. Our results extend the existing work on complex contagions in
several directions by i) providing solutions for coupled random networks whose
vertices are neither identical nor disjoint, (ii) highlighting the effect of
content on the dynamics of complex contagions, and (iii) showing that
content-dependent propagation over a multiplex network leads to a subtle
relation between the giant vulnerable component of the graph and the global

which can significantly help users find relevant and interesting items for them
in the information era. However, a vast class of researches in this area mainly
focus on predicting missing links in bipartite user-item networks (represented
as behavioral networks). Comparatively, the social impact, especially the
network structure based properties, is relatively lack of study. In this paper,
we firstly obtain five corresponding network-based features, including user
activity, average neighbors' degree, clustering coefficient, assortative
coefficient and discrimination, from social and behavioral networks,
respectively. A hybrid algorithm is proposed to integrate those features from
two respective networks. Subsequently, we employ a machine learning process to
use those features to provide recommendation results in a binary classifier
method. Experimental results on a real dataset, Flixster, suggest that the
proposed method can significantly enhance the algorithmic accuracy. In
addition, as network-based properties consider not only the social activities,
but also take into account user preferences in the behavioral networks,
therefore, it performs much better than that from either social or behavioral
networks. Furthermore, since the features based on the behavioral network
contain more diverse and meaningfully structural information, they play a vital
role in uncovering users' potential preference, which, might show light in
deeply understanding the structure and function of the social and behavioral
networks.

appear in many applications such as social network analysis, recommender

based models but disregarding local structure in the network, or focus
exclusively on capturing local structure of objects based on latent blockmodels
without coupling with latent characteristics of objects. To combine the
benefits of the previous work, we propose a novel model that can simultaneously
incorporate the effect of latent features and covariates if any, as well as the
effect of latent structure that may exist in the data. To achieve this, we
model the relation graph as a function of both latent feature factors and
latent cluster memberships of objects to collectively discover globally
predictive intrinsic properties of objects and capture latent block structure
in the network to improve prediction performance. We also develop an
optimization transfer algorithm based on the generalized EM-style strategy to
learn the latent factors. We prove the efficacy of our proposed model through
the link prediction task and cluster analysis task, and extensive experiments
on the synthetic data and several real world datasets suggest that our proposed
LFBM model outperforms the other state of the art approaches in the evaluated

information. This demands new ways of analysis in order to offer insight into
this stream right at the moment of the creation of the information, because
lots of this data is only relevant within a short period of time. To address
this problem real time search engines have recently received increased
attention. They take into account the continuous flow of information
differently than traditional web search by incorporating temporal and social
features, that describe the context of the information during its creation.
Standard approaches where data first get stored and then is processed from a
peristent storage suffer from latency. We want to address the fluent and rapid
nature of text stream by providing an event based approach that analyses
directly the stream of information. In a first step we want to define the
difference between real time search and traditional search to clarify the
demands in modern text filtering. In a second step we want to show how event
based features can be used to support the tasks of real time search engines.
Using the example of Twitter we present in this paper a way how to combine an
event based approach with text mining and information filtering concepts in
order to classify incoming information based on stream features. We calculate
stream dependant features and feed them into a neural network in order to
classify the text streams. We show the separative capabilities of event based
features as the foundation for a real time search engine.

important tool for collecting uniform node samples so as to consistently
estimate and uncover various characteristics of complex networks. The so-called
simple random walk with re-weighting (SRW-rw) and Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
algorithm have been popular in the literature for such unbiased graph sampling.
However, an unavoidable downside of their core random walks -- slow diffusion
over the space, can cause poor estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose
non-backtracking random walk with re-weighting (NBRW-rw) and MH algorithm with
delayed acceptance (MHDA) which are theoretically guaranteed to achieve, at
almost no additional cost, not only unbiased graph sampling but also higher
efficiency (smaller asymptotic variance of the resulting unbiased estimators)
than the SRW-rw and the MH algorithm, respectively. In particular, a remarkable
feature of the MHDA is its applicability for any non-uniform node sampling like
the MH algorithm, but ensuring better sampling efficiency than the MH
algorithm. We also provide simulation results to confirm our theoretical
findings.

  Application to Behavioral Data Analysis over Social Networks","  One of the interesting and important problems of information diffusion over a
large social network is to identify an appropriate model from a limited amount
of diffusion information. There are two contrasting approaches to model
information diffusion: a push type model known as Independent Cascade (IC)
model and a pull type model known as Linear Threshold (LT) model. We extend
these two models (called AsIC and AsLT in this paper) to incorporate
asynchronous time delay and investigate 1) how they differ from or similar to
each other in terms of information diffusion, 2) whether the model itself is
learnable or not from the observed information diffusion data, and 3) which
model is more appropriate to explain for a particular topic (information) to
diffuse/propagate. We first show there can be variations with respect to how
the time delay is modeled, and derive the likelihood of the observed data being
generated for each model. Using one particular time delay model, we show the
model parameters are learnable from a limited amount of observation. We then
propose a method based on predictive accuracy by which to select a model which
better explains the observed data. Extensive evaluations were performed. We
first show using synthetic data with the network structures taken from real
networks that there are considerable behavioral differences between the AsIC
and the AsLT models, the proposed methods accurately and stably learn the model
parameters, and identify the correct diffusion model from a limited amount of
observation data. We next apply these methods to behavioral analysis of topic
propagation using the real blog propagation data, and show there is a clear
indication as to which topic better follows which model although the results
are rather insensitive to the model selected at the level of discussing how far
and fast each topic propagates from the learned parameter values.

  Clustering","  Background: How to extract useful information from complex biological
networks is a major goal in many fields, especially in genomics and proteomics.
We have shown in several works that iterative hierarchical clustering, as
implemented in the UVCluster program, is a powerful tool to analyze many of
those networks. However, the amount of computation time required to perform
UVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to
efficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of
iterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections.
First, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different
approaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related
algorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms
based on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as
UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the
trees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and
intercluster connections. Outputs compatible with the phylogenetic software
MEGA and the Cytoscape package are generated, allowing the results to be easily
visualized.
  Conclusions/Significance: The four main advantages of Jerarca in respect to
UVCluster are: 1) Improved speed of a novel UVCluster algorithm; 2) Additional,
alternative strategies to perform iterative hierarchical clustering; 3)
Automatic evaluation of the hierarchical trees to obtain optimal partitions;
and, 4) Outputs compatible with popular software such as MEGA and Cytoscape.

dynamic and typically exhibits some turnover in membership over time as
personal circumstances change. However, the consequences of such changes on the
distribution of an ego's network ties are not well understood. Here we use a
unique 18-month data set that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to
track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making
the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that
individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how
interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego,
these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable
turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus as new network
members are added, some old network members are either replaced or receive
fewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network
members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as
the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort
required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional
investments.

been a very popular and active area of research. A reasonable model should not
only replicate all the structural properties that are observed in real world
networks (for example, heavy tailed degree distributions, high clustering and
small diameter), but it should also be amenable to mathematical analysis. There
are plenty of models that succeed in the first task but are hard to analyze
rigorously. On the other hand, a multitude of proposed models, like classical
random graphs, can be studied mathematically, but fail in creating certain
aspects that are observed in real-world networks.
  Recently, Papadopoulos, Krioukov, Boguna and Vahdat [INFOCOM'10] introduced a
random geometric graph model that is based on hyperbolic geometry. The authors
argued empirically and by some preliminary mathematical analysis that the
resulting graphs have many of the desired properties. Moreover, by computing
explicitly a maximum likelihood fit of the Internet graph, they demonstrated
impressively that this model is adequate for reproducing the structure of real
graphs with high accuracy.
  In this work we initiate the rigorous study of random hyperbolic graphs. We
compute exact asymptotic expressions for the expected number of vertices of
degree k for all k up to the maximum degree and provide small probabilities for
large deviations. We also prove a constant lower bound for the clustering
coefficient. In particular, our findings confirm rigorously that the degree
sequence follows a power-law distribution with controllable exponent and that
the clustering is nonvanishing.

HIV/AIDS-related high risk populations. However, recent studies have shown that
traditional RDS methods are likely to generate large variances and may be
severely biased since the assumptions behind RDS are seldom fully met in real
life. To improve estimation in RDS studies, we propose a new method to generate
estimates with ego network data, which is collected by asking RDS respondents
about the composition of their personal networks, such as \"what proportion of
your friends are married?\". By simulations on an extracted real-world social
network of gay men as well as on artificial networks with varying structural
properties, we show that the new estimator, RDSI^{ego} shows superior
performance over traditional RDS estimators. Importantly, RDSI^{ego} exhibits
strong robustness to the preference of peer recruitment and variations in
network structural properties, such as homophily, activity ratio, and community
structure. While the biases of traditional RDS estimators can sometimes be as
large as 10%~20%, biases of all RDSI^{ego} estimates are well restrained to be
less than 2%. The positive results henceforth encourage researchers to collect
ego network data for variables of interests by RDS, for both hard-to-access
populations and general populations when random sampling is not applicable. The
limitation of RDSI^{ego} is evaluated by simulating RDS assuming different
level of reporting error.

that combines link and content analysis. Most existing work combines link and
content information by a generative model. There are two major shortcomings
with the existing approaches. First, they assume that the probability of
creating a link between two nodes is determined only by the community
memberships of the nodes; however other factors (e.g. popularity) could also
affect the link pattern. Second, they use generative models to model the
content of individual nodes, whereas these generative models are vulnerable to
the content attributes that are irrelevant to communities. We propose a
Bayesian framework for combining link and content information for community
detection that explicitly addresses these shortcomings. A new link model is
presented that introduces a random variable to capture the node popularity when
deciding the link between two nodes; a discriminative model is used to
determine the community membership of a node by its content. An approximate
inference algorithm is presented for efficient Bayesian inference. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed framework outperforms several
state-of-theart approaches in combining link and content information for
community detection.

much attention, the properties of the close-knit friendship structures remain
an important question. Here, we mainly focus on how these mesoscale structures
are affected by the local and global structural properties. Analyzing the data
of four large-scale online social networks reveals several common structural
properties. It is found that not only the local structures given by the
indegree, outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar
scaling behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of
close-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The degree
correlation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We propose a simple
directed network model that captures the observed properties. The model
incorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and preferential attachment. Through
rate equation analysis of our model, the local-scale and mesoscale structural
properties are derived. In the local-scale, the same scaling behavior of
indegree and outdegree distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes
both growing as the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal
degree distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear
relationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In the
mesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing close-knit
friendship structures are found to exhibit identical power-laws, a behavior
attributed to the negligible degree correlations. Intriguingly, all the
power-law exponents of the distributions in the local-scale and mesoscale
depend only on one global parameter -- the mean in/outdegree, while both the
mean in/outdegree and the reciprocity together determine the ratio of the
reciprocal degree of a node to its in/outdegree.

Next we give an efficient algorithm to determine whether a graph is

The latter notion is used in formulation and analysis of spread of influence

sufficient and necessary relationship between dynamic monopolies and
generalized degeneracy. As applications of the previous results we consider the
problem of determining the maximum size of $\kappa$-degenerate (or

  Estimation over Adaptive Networks","  Adaptive networks consist of a collection of nodes with adaptation and
learning abilities. The nodes interact with each other on a local level and
diffuse information across the network to solve estimation and inference tasks
in a distributed manner. In this work, we compare the mean-square performance
of two main strategies for distributed estimation over networks: consensus
strategies and diffusion strategies. The analysis in the paper confirms that
under constant step-sizes, diffusion strategies allow information to diffuse
more thoroughly through the network and this property has a favorable effect on
the evolution of the network: diffusion networks are shown to converge faster
and reach lower mean-square deviation than consensus networks, and their
mean-square stability is insensitive to the choice of the combination weights.
In contrast, and surprisingly, it is shown that consensus networks can become
unstable even if all the individual nodes are stable and able to solve the
estimation task on their own. When this occurs, cooperation over the network
leads to a catastrophic failure of the estimation task. This phenomenon does
not occur for diffusion networks: we show that stability of the individual
nodes always ensures stability of the diffusion network irrespective of the
combination topology. Simulation results support the theoretical findings.

other through reaction channels, are ubiquitous across many scientific and
engineering disciplines. Examples include biochemical, pharmacokinetic,
epidemiological, ecological, social, neural, and multi-agent networks. A common
approach to modeling such networks is by a master equation that governs the
dynamic evolution of the joint probability mass function of the underling
population process and naturally leads to Markovian dynamics for such process.
Due however to the nonlinear nature of most reactions, the computation and
analysis of the resulting stochastic population dynamics is a difficult task.
This review article provides a coherent and comprehensive coverage of recently
developed approaches and methods to tackle this problem. After reviewing a
general framework for modeling Markovian reaction networks and giving specific
examples, the authors present numerical and computational techniques capable of
evaluating or approximating the solution of the master equation, discuss a
recently developed approach for studying the stationary behavior of Markovian
reaction networks using a potential energy landscape perspective, and provide
an introduction to the emerging theory of thermodynamic analysis of such
networks. Three representative problems of opinion formation, transcription
regulation, and neural network dynamics are used as illustrative examples.

Google has introduced Google+ (G+) and reported a significant growth in its

despite the dominance of Facebook and Twitter?\".
  This paper tackles the above question by presenting a detailed
characterization of G+ based on large scale measurements. We identify the main
components of G+ structure, characterize the key features of their users and
their evolution over time. We then conduct detailed analysis on the evolution
of connectivity and activity among users in the largest connected component
(LCC) of G+ structure, and compare their characteristics with other major OSNs.
We show that despite the dramatic growth in the size of G+, the relative size
of LCC has been decreasing and its connectivity has become less clustered.
While the aggregate user activity has gradually increased, only a very small
fraction of users exhibit any type of activity. To our knowledge, our study

group dynamics in which emotions are involved (\v{S}uvakov et al). Full
understanding of the underlying mechanisms, however, remains a challenging
task. Using agent-based computer simulations, in this paper we study dynamics
of emotional communications in online social networks. The rules that guide how
the agents interact are motivated, and the realistic network structure and some
important parameters are inferred from the empirical dataset of
\texttt{MySpace} social network. Agent's emotional state is characterized by
two variables representing psychological arousal---reactivity to stimuli, and
valence---attractiveness or aversiveness, by which common emotions can be
defined. Agent's action is triggered by increased arousal. High-resolution
dynamics is implemented where each message carrying agent's emotion along the
network link is identified and its effect on the recipient agent is considered
as continuously aging in time. Our results demonstrate that (i) aggregated
group behaviors may arise from individual emotional actions of agents; (ii)
collective states characterized by temporal correlations and dominant positive
emotions emerge, similar to the empirical system; (iii) nature of the driving
signal---rate of user's stepping into online world, has profound effects on
building the coherent behaviors, which are observed for users in online social
networks. Further, our simulations suggest that spreading patterns differ for
the emotions, e.g., \"enthusiastic\" and \"ashamed\", which have entirely different
emotional content. {\bf {All data used in this study are fully anonymized.}}

  Databases","  Many studies have been conducted on seeking the efficient solution for
subgraph similarity search over certain (deterministic) graphs due to its wide
application in many fields, including bioinformatics, social network analysis,
and Resource Description Framework (RDF) data management. All these works
assume that the underlying data are certain. However, in reality, graphs are
often noisy and uncertain due to various factors, such as errors in data
extraction, inconsistencies in data integration, and privacy preserving
purposes. Therefore, in this paper, we study subgraph similarity search on
large probabilistic graph databases. Different from previous works assuming
that edges in an uncertain graph are independent of each other, we study the
uncertain graphs where edges' occurrences are correlated. We formally prove
that subgraph similarity search over probabilistic graphs is #P-complete, thus,
we employ a filter-and-verify framework to speed up the search. In the
filtering phase,we develop tight lower and upper bounds of subgraph similarity
probability based on a probabilistic matrix index, PMI. PMI is composed of
discriminative subgraph features associated with tight lower and upper bounds
of subgraph isomorphism probability. Based on PMI, we can sort out a large
number of probabilistic graphs and maximize the pruning capability. During the
verification phase, we develop an efficient sampling algorithm to validate the
remaining candidates. The efficiency of our proposed solutions has been
verified through extensive experiments.

Our results suggest that percolation for small $r$ below $r_{\rm max}\approx 8$

first-order transition. For $r<r_{\rm max}$, the critical threshold increases

most vulnerable when the distance between interdependent nodes is in the

effective exploitation of social influence in social networks. However, few
existing influence models are both tractable and efficient for describing the
information propagation process and quantitatively measuring social influence.
To this end, in this paper, we develop a linear social influence model, named
Circuit due to its close relation to the circuit network. Based on the
predefined four axioms of social influence, we first demonstrate that our model
can efficiently measure the influence strength between any pair of nodes. Along
this line, an upper bound of the node(s)' influence is identified for potential
use, e.g., reducing the search space. Furthermore, we provide the physical
implication of the Circuit model and also a deep analysis of its relationships
with the existing methods, such as PageRank. Then, we propose that the Circuit
model provides a natural solution to the problems of computing each single
node's authority and finding a set of nodes for social influence maximization.
At last, the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on the real-world
data. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that Circuit model
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and can greatly alleviate
the computation burden of the influence maximization problem.

to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and
Facebook. The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow
rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity
estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in
turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many
methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and
are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to
address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank
approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient
to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can
handle massive networks. The basis idea of MSLP is to construct low rank
approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner. Based
on this approach, MSLP combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust
and accurate predictions. Experimental results on real-life datasets with more
than a million nodes show the superior performance and scalability of our
method.

between Milgram condition and the generalized clustering coefficient, which was
introduced as an index for measuring the number of closed paths by us, are
absolutely different in scale free networks (Barabasi and Albert) and small
world networks (Watts and Strogatz, Watts). This fact implies that the effect
of closed paths on information propagation is different in both networks. In
this article, we first investigate the difference and pursuit what is a crucial
mathematical quantity for information propagation. As a result we find that a
sort of \"disorder\" plays more important role for information propagation than
partially closed paths included in a network. Next we inquired into it in more
detail by introducing two types of intermediate networks. Then we find that the
average of the local clustering coefficient and the generalized clustering
coefficients $C_{(q)}$ have some different functions and important meanings,
respectively. We also find that $C_{(q)}$ is close to the propagation of
information on networks. Lastly, we show that realizability of six degrees of

Since network representation can be very complex and can contain different
variants in the traditional graph model, each algorithm in the literature
focuses on some of these properties and establishes, explicitly or implicitly,
its own definition of community. According to this definition it then extracts
the communities that are able to reflect only some of the features of real

inference (CSI): Making inferences from causal interventions on stable behavior
in strategic settings. Applications include the identification of the most

policy-making analysis. Motivated by the computational work on LIGs, we cast
the learning problem as maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of a generative
model defined by pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). Our simple formulation
uncovers the fundamental interplay between goodness-of-fit and model
complexity: good models capture equilibrium behavior within the data while
controlling the true number of equilibria, including those unobserved. We
provide a generalization bound establishing the sample complexity for MLE in
our framework. We propose several algorithms including convex loss minimization
(CLM) and sigmoidal approximations. We prove that the number of exact PSNE in
LIGs is small, with high probability; thus, CLM is sound. We illustrate our
approach on synthetic data and real-world U.S. congressional voting records. We
briefly discuss our learning framework's generality and potential applicability

  Discursive Knowledge","  Positional and relational perspectives on network data have led to two
different research traditions in textual analysis and social network analysis,
respectively. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) focuses on the latent dimensions
in textual data; social network analysis (SNA) on the observable networks. The
two coupled topographies of information-processing in the network space and
meaning-processing in the vector space operate with different (nonlinear)
dynamics. The historical dynamics of information processing in observable
networks organizes the system into instantiations; the systems dynamics,
however, can be considered as self-organizing in terms of fluxes of
communication along the various dimensions that operate with different codes.
The development over time adds evolutionary differentiation to the historical
integration; a richer structure can process more complexity.

  Citation Network","  The network of patents connected by citations is an evolving graph, which
provides a representation of the innovation process. A patent citing another
implies that the cited patent reflects a piece of previously existing knowledge
that the citing patent builds upon. A methodology presented here (i) identifies
actual clusters of patents: i.e. technological branches, and (ii) gives
predictions about the temporal changes of the structure of the clusters. A
predictor, called the {citation vector}, is defined for characterizing
technological development to show how a patent cited by other patents belongs
to various industrial fields. The clustering technique adopted is able to
detect the new emerging recombinations, and predicts emerging new technology
clusters. The predictive ability of our new method is illustrated on the
example of USPTO subcategory 11, Agriculture, Food, Textiles. A cluster of
patents is determined based on citation data up to 1991, which shows
significant overlap of the class 442 formed at the beginning of 1997. These new
tools of predictive analytics could support policy decision making processes in
science and technology, and help formulate recommendations for action.

  dynamical systems","  Characterization of real-world complex systems increasingly involves the
study of their topological structure using graph theory. Among global network
properties, small-world property, consisting in existence of relatively short
paths together with high clustering of the network, is one of the most
discussed and studied. When dealing with coupled dynamical systems, links among
units of the system are commonly quantified by a measure of pairwise
statistical dependence of observed time series (functional connectivity). We
argue that the functional connectivity approach leads to upwardly biased
estimates of small-world characteristics (with respect to commonly used random
graph models) due to partial transitivity of the accepted functional
connectivity measures such as the correlation coefficient. In particular, this
may lead to observation of small-world characteristics in connectivity graphs
estimated from generic randomly connected dynamical systems. The ubiquity and
robustness of the phenomenon is documented by an extensive parameter study of
its manifestation in a multivariate linear autoregressive process, with
discussion of the potential relevance for nonlinear processes and measures.

derived. These matrices, which are connected to path enumeration and random
walks, are used in community detection methods or in computation of centrality
measures for complex networks. The focus is on a number of known centrality
measures, which inherit the connections established for similarity matrices.
These measures are based on the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix,
path enumeration, as well as on the stationary state, stochastic matrix or mean
first-passage times of a random walk. Particular attention is paid to the
maximal-entropy random walk, which serves as a very distinct alternative to the
ordinary random walk used in network analysis.
  The various importance measures, defined both with the use of ordinary random
walk and the maximal-entropy random walk, are compared numerically on a set of
benchmark graphs. It is shown that groups of centrality measures defined with
the two random walks cluster into two separate families. In particular, the
group of centralities for the maximal-entropy random walk, connected to the
eigenvector centrality and path enumeration, is strongly distinct from all the
other measures and produces largely equivalent results.

some classes of time-dependent networks. Specifically, we consider the use of
statistical null models for facilitating the principled identification of
structural modules in semi-decomposable systems. Null models play an important
role both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in
the subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community
structure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and
show how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By
considering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of
network diagnostics over optimizations (`optimization variance') and over
randomizations of network structure (`randomization variance'). Because the
modularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly-degenerate
local optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to
construct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for
statistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ
ensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators
and empirical neuroscience data.

The structure of a network characterizes the interactions among elements of the
system, and facilitates the study of many dynamical processes taking place on
it. In previous investigations, the topological infrastructure underlying
dynamical systems is simplified as a static and invariable skeleton. However,
this assumption cannot cover the temporal features of many time-evolution
networks, whose components are evolving and mutating. In this letter, utilizing
the log data of WiFi users in a Chinese university campus, we infuse the
temporal dimension into the construction of dynamical human contact network. By
quantitative comparison with the traditional aggregation approach, we find that
the temporal contact network differs in many features, e.g., the reachability,
the path length distribution. We conclude that the correlation between temporal
path length and duration is not only determined by their definitions, but also
influenced by the microdynamical features of human activities under certain
social circumstance as well. The time order of individuals' interaction events
plays a critical role in understanding many dynamical processes via human close
proximity interactions studied in this letter. Besides, our study also provides
a promising measure to identify the potential superspreaders by distinguishing
the nodes functioning as the relay hub.

interaction within members of sport teams.We analyze the interaction of batsmen
in International Cricket matches. We generate batting partnership network (BPN)
for different teams and determine the exact values of clustering coefficient,
average degree, average shortest path length of the networks and compare them
with the Erd\text{\\"{o}}s-R\text{\'{e}}nyi model. We observe that the networks
display small-world behavior and are disassortative in nature. We find that
most connected batsman is not necessarily the most central and most central
players are not necessarily the one with high batting averages. We study the
community structure of the BPNs and identify each player's role based on
inter-community and intra-community links. We observe that {\it Sir DG
Bradman}, regarded as the best batsman in Cricket history does not occupy the
central position in the network $-$ the so-called connector hub. We extend our
analysis to quantify the performance, relative importance and effect of
removing a player from the team, based on different centrality scores.

  Approach","  Community detection is one of the most active fields in complex networks
analysis, due to its potential value in practical applications. Many works
inspired by different paradigms are devoted to the development of algorithmic
solutions allowing to reveal the network structure in such cohesive subgroups.
Comparative studies reported in the literature usually rely on a performance
measure considering the community structure as a partition (Rand Index,
Normalized Mutual information, etc.). However, this type of comparison neglects
the topological properties of the communities. In this article, we present a
comprehensive comparative study of a representative set of community detection
methods, in which we adopt both types of evaluation. Community-oriented
topological measures are used to qualify the communities and evaluate their
deviation from the reference structure. In order to mimic real-world systems,
we use artificially generated realistic networks. It turns out there is no
equivalence between both approaches: a high performance does not necessarily
correspond to correct topological properties, and vice-versa. They can
therefore be considered as complementary, and we recommend applying both of
them in order to perform a complete and accurate assessment.

  data","  Electoral prediction from Twitter data is an appealing research topic. It
seems relatively straightforward and the prevailing view is overly optimistic.
This is problematic because while simple approaches are assumed to be good
enough, core problems are not addressed. Thus, this paper aims to (1) provide a
balanced and critical review of the state of the art; (2) cast light on the
presume predictive power of Twitter data; and (3) depict a roadmap to push
forward the field. Hence, a scheme to characterize Twitter prediction methods
is proposed. It covers every aspect from data collection to performance
evaluation, through data processing and vote inference. Using that scheme,
prior research is analyzed and organized to explain the main approaches taken
up to date but also their weaknesses. This is the first meta-analysis of the
whole body of research regarding electoral prediction from Twitter data. It
reveals that its presumed predictive power regarding electoral prediction has
been rather exaggerated: although social media may provide a glimpse on
electoral outcomes current research does not provide strong evidence to support
it can replace traditional polls. Finally, future lines of research along with
a set of requirements they must fulfill are provided.

  Disaster","  Each year, crowd disasters happen in different areas of the world. How and
why do such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior
of people or a psychological state of panic that makes the crowd 'go mad'? Or
are they a tragic consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other
questions are addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available
videos and materials, which document the planning and organization of the Love
Parade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our
analysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also
provide a new perspective on concepts such as 'intentional pushing', 'mass
panic', 'stampede', and 'crowd crushs'. The focus of our analysis is on the
contributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal
issues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video
recordings show that, in Duisburg, people stumbled and piled up due to a
'domino effect', resulting from a phenomenon called 'crowd turbulence' or
'crowd quake'. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be
distinguished from crowd disasters resulting from 'panic stampedes' or 'crowd
crushes'. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying
feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities.
Accordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from
anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations
to help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale
to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow
preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss the
merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering
that today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.

  in the World City Network","  Empirical research on world cities often draws on Taylor's (2001) notion of
an 'interlocking network model', in which office networks of globalized service
firms are assumed to shape the spatialities of urban networks. In spite of its
many merits, this approach is limited because the resultant adjacency matrices
are not really fit for network-analytic calculations. We therefore propose a
fresh analytical approach using a primary linkage algorithm that produces a
one-mode directed graph based on Taylor's two-mode city/firm network data. The
procedure has the advantage of creating less dense networks when compared to
the interlocking network model, while nonetheless retaining the network
structure apparent in the initial dataset. We randomize the empirical network
with a bootstrapping simulation approach, and compare the simulated parameters
of this null-model with our empirical network parameter (i.e. betweenness
centrality). We find that our approach produces results that are comparable to
those of the standard interlocking network model. However, because our approach
is based on an actual graph representation and network analysis, we are able to
assess cities' position in the network at large. For instance, we find that
cities such as Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, Almaty and Karachi hold more strategic
and valuable positions than suggested in the interlocking networks as they play
a bridging role in connecting cities across regions. In general, we argue that
our graph representation allows for further and deeper analysis of the original
data, further extending world city network research into a theory-based
empirical research approach.

their effect, it is useful to build ensembles of networks constrained to have a
given value of a structural measure, such as the degree-degree correlation $r$,
being random in other aspects and preserving the degree distribution. This can
be done through Monte Carlo optimization procedures. Meanwhile, when tuning
$r$, other network properties may concomitantly change. Then, in this work we
analyze, for the $r$-ensembles, the impact of $r$ on properties such as
transitivity, branching and characteristic lengths, that are relevant when
investigating spreading phenomena on these networks. The present analysis is
performed for networks with degree distributions of two main types: either
localized around a typical degree (with exponentially bounded asymptotic decay)
or broadly distributed (with power-law decay). Correlation bounds and size
effects are also investigated.

online contacts. In this paper we have compiled and analyzed two datasets from
\texttt{MySpace}. The data contain networked dialogs occurring within a
specified time depth, high temporal resolution, and texts of messages, in which
the emotion valence is assessed by using SentiStrength classifier. Performing a
comprehensive analysis we obtain three groups of results: Dynamic topology of
the dialogs-based networks have characteristic structure with Zipf's
distribution of communities, low link reciprocity, and disassortative
correlations. Overlaps supporting \"weak-ties\" hypothesis are found to follow
the laws recently conjectured for online games. Long-range temporal
correlations and persistent fluctuations occur in the time series of messages
carrying positive (negative) emotion. Patterns of user communications have
dominant positive emotion (attractiveness) and strong impact of circadian

to the family of multiscale methods whose goal is to approximate the system at

combining the information from coarse scales. In recent years these methods

  Identifying Real World Events in Highly Dynamic Environments","  Due to their real time nature, microblog streams are a rich source of dynamic
information, for example, about emerging events. Existing techniques for
discovering such events from a microblog stream in real time (such as Twitter
trending topics), have several lacunae when used for discovering emerging
events; extant graph based event detection techniques are not practical in
microblog settings due to their complexity; and conventional techniques, which
have been developed for blogs, web-pages, etc., involving the use of keyword
search, are only useful for finding information about known events. Hence, in
this paper, we present techniques to discover events that are unraveling in
microblog message streams in real time so that such events can be reported as
soon as they occur. We model the problem as discovering dense clusters in
highly dynamic graphs. Despite many recent advances in graph analysis, ours is
the first technique to identify dense clusters in massive and highly dynamic
graphs in real time. Given the characteristics of microblog streams, in order
to find clusters without missing any events, we propose and exploit a novel
graph property which we call short-cycle property. Our algorithms find these
clusters efficiently in spite of rapid changes to the microblog streams.
Further we present a novel ranking function to identify the important events.
Besides proving the correctness of our algorithms we show their practical

different scientific tools and in a broad range of applications. Many
approaches to extracting data from the Web have been designed to solve specific
problems and operate in ad-hoc domains. Other approaches, instead, heavily
reuse techniques and algorithms developed in the field of Information
Extraction.
  This survey aims at providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the
literature in the field of Web Data Extraction. We provided a simple
classification framework in which existing Web Data Extraction applications are
grouped into two main classes, namely applications at the Enterprise level and
at the Social Web level. At the Enterprise level, Web Data Extraction
techniques emerge as a key tool to perform data analysis in Business and
Competitive Intelligence systems as well as for business process
re-engineering. At the Social Web level, Web Data Extraction techniques allow
to gather a large amount of structured data continuously generated and
disseminated by Web 2.0, Social Media and Online Social Network users and this
offers unprecedented opportunities to analyze human behavior at a very large
scale. We discuss also the potential of cross-fertilization, i.e., on the
possibility of re-using Web Data Extraction techniques originally designed to
work in a given domain, in other domains.

mining. The important applications of the influence analysis in social network
include influence maximization for viral marketing, finding the most
influential nodes, online advertising, etc. For many of these applications, it
is crucial to evaluate the influenceability of a node. In this paper, we study
the problem of evaluating influenceability of nodes in social network based on
the widely used influence spread model, namely, the independent cascade model.
Since this problem is #P-complete, most existing work is based on Naive
Monte-Carlo (\nmc) sampling. However, the \nmc estimator typically results in a
large variance, which significantly reduces its effectiveness. To overcome this
problem, we propose two families of new estimators based on the idea of
stratified sampling. We first present two basic stratified sampling (\bss)
estimators, namely \bssi estimator and \bssii estimator, which partition the
entire population into $2^r$ and $r+1$ strata by choosing $r$ edges
respectively. Second, to further reduce the variance, we find that both \bssi
and \bssii estimators can be recursively performed on each stratum, thus we
propose two recursive stratified sampling (\rss) estimators, namely \rssi
estimator and \rssii estimator. Theoretically, all of our estimators are shown
to be unbiased and their variances are significantly smaller than the variance
of the \nmc estimator. Finally, our extensive experimental results on both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our new
estimators.

of a terrorist group, detecting sudden spurts and downfalls in this profile,
and, in general, tracking it over a period of time. Toward this goal, a
$d$-state hidden Markov model (HMM) that captures the latent states underlying
the dynamics of the group and thus its activity profile is developed. The
simplest setting of $d=2$ corresponds to the case where the dynamics are
coarsely quantized as Active and Inactive, respectively. A state estimation
strategy that exploits the underlying HMM structure is then developed for spurt
detection and tracking. This strategy is shown to track even nonpersistent
changes that last only for a short duration at the cost of learning the
underlying model. Case studies with real terrorism data from open-source

cooperators are found to be beneficial for the occurrence and maintenance of
cooperation. In the optional public goods game, the rock-scissors-paper cycles
of different strategies yield oscillatory cooperation but not stable
cooperation. In this paper, by incorporating population density and individual
mobility into the spatial optional public goods game, we study the
coevolutionary dynamics of strategy updating and benefit-seeking migration.
With low population density and slow movement, an optimal level of cooperation
is easy to be reached. An increase in population density and speed-up of
free-floating of competitive agents will suppress cooperation. A log-log
relation between the levels of cooperation and the free-floating probability is
found. Theoretical analysis indicates that the decrease of cooperator frequency
in the present model should result from the increased interactions between
different agents, which may originate from the increased cluster size or the
speed-up of random-movement.

the relationship between the strength of the community structure and the
network transitivity (or clustering coefficient). Although intuitively
appealing, this analysis was not performed before. We adopt an approach based
on random models to empirically study how one property varies depending on the
other. It turns out the transitivity increases with the community structure
strength, and is also affected by the distribution of the community sizes.
Furthermore, increasing the transitivity also results in a stronger community
structure. More surprisingly, if a very weak community structure causes almost
zero transitivity, the opposite is not true and a network with a close to zero
transitivity can still have a clearly defined community structure. Further
analytical work is necessary to characterize the exact nature of the identified
relationship.

selection: the data are sparse and globally dependent, and models are typically
high-dimensional and have large numbers of latent variables. Together, these
issues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for
networks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by
considering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into
communities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest
of the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,
under which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of
the blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution
within each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models
add a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree. The choice
between ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make
very different inferences about communities. We present the first principled
and tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected
block models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of
log-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial
departures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop
linear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block
model and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications to
simulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our approximations.
Our results thus both solve the practical problem of deciding on degree
correction, and point to a general approach to model selection in network
analysis.

becoming ubiquitous today and typically support multiple data rates. In such
multi-rate WLANs, distributed medium access and rate adaptation are two key
elements to achieve efficient radio resource utilization, especially in
non-cooperative environments. In this paper, we present an analytical study on
the non-cooperative multi-rate WLANs composed of selfish users jointly
adjusting their data rate and contention window size at the medium access level
to maximize their own throughput, irrespective of the impact of their selfish
behaviors on overall system performance. Specifically, we develop an adapted
Tit-For-Tat (TFT) strategy to guide the system to an efficient equilibrium in
non-cooperative environments. We model the interactions among selfish users
under the adapted TFT framework as a non-cooperative joint medium access and
rate adaptation game. A systematic analysis is conducted on the structural
properties of the game to provide insights on the interaction between rate
adaptation and 802.11 medium access control in a competitive setting. We show
that the game has multiple equilibria, which, after the equilibrium refinement
process that we develop, reduce to a unique efficient equilibrium. We further
develop a distributed algorithm to achieve this equilibrium and demonstrate
that the equilibrium achieves the performance very close to the system optimum
in a social perspective.

systems have become one of the research areas of growing importance. A social
network consists of nodes - social entities and edges linking pairs of nodes.
In regular, one-layered social networks, two nodes - i.e. people are connected
with a single edge whereas in the multi-layered social networks, there may be
many links of different types for a pair of nodes. Nowadays data about people
and their interactions, which exists in all social media, provides information
about many different types of relationships within one network. Analysing this
data one can obtain knowledge not only about the structure and characteristics
of the network but also gain understanding about semantic of human relations.
Are they direct or not? Do people tend to sustain single or multiple relations
with a given person? What types of communication is the most important for
them? Answers to these and more questions enable us to draw conclusions about
semantic of human interactions. Unfortunately, most of the methods used for
social network analysis (SNA) may be applied only to one-layered social
networks. Thus, some new structural measures for multi-layered social networks
are proposed in the paper, in particular: cross-layer clustering coefficient,
cross-layer degree centrality and various versions of multi-layered degree
centralities. Authors also investigated the dynamics of multi-layered
neighbourhood for five different layers within the social network. The
evaluation of the presented concepts on the real-world dataset is presented.
The measures proposed in the paper may directly be used to various methods for
collective classification, in which nodes are assigned to labels according to
their structural input features.

network analysis. The problem of $k$-core decomposition is to calculate the
core number for every node in a graph. Previous studies mainly focus on
$k$-core decomposition in a static graph. There exists a linear time algorithm
for $k$-core decomposition in a static graph. However, in many real-world
applications such as online social networks and the Internet, the graph
typically evolves over time. Under such applications, a key issue is to
maintain the core number of nodes given the graph changes over time. A simple
implementation is to perform the linear time algorithm to recompute the core
number for every node after the graph is updated. Such simple implementation is
expensive when the graph is very large. In this paper, we propose a new
efficient algorithm to maintain the core number for every node in a dynamic
graph. Our main result is that only certain nodes need to update their core
number given the graph is changed by inserting/deleting an edge. We devise an
efficient algorithm to identify and recompute the core number of such nodes.
The complexity of our algorithm is independent of the graph size. In addition,
to further accelerate the algorithm, we develop two pruning strategies by
exploiting the lower and upper bounds of the core number. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments over both real-world and synthetic datasets, and the
results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

report, we show that graph sampling algorithms currently proposed in the
literature are not able to preserve network properties even with sample sizes
containing as many as 20% of the nodes from the original graph. We present a
new sampling algorithm, called Tiny Sample Extractor, with a new goal of a
sample size smaller than 5% of the original graph while preserving two key
properties of a network, the degree distribution and its clustering
co-efficient. Our approach is based on a new empirical method of estimating
measurement biases in crawling algorithms and compensating for them
accordingly. We present a detailed comparison of best known graph sampling
algorithms, focusing in particular on how the properties of the sample
subgraphs converge to those of the original graph as they grow. These results
show that our sampling algorithm extracts a smaller subgraph than other
algorithms while also achieving a closer convergence to the degree
distribution, measured by the degree exponent, of the original graph. The
subgraph generated by the Tiny Sample Extractor, however, is not necessarily
representative of the full graph with regard to other properties such as
assortativity. This indicates that the problem of extracting a truly
representative small subgraph from a large graph remains unsolved.

motivation to adopt is composed of three terms, representing personal
preference, an average of each individual's network neighbours' states and a
system average, which is a measure of the current social trend. The adoption
state of a node changes if a weighted linear combination of these factors
exceeds some threshold. Numerical simulations have been carried out, computing
the average uptake after a sufficient number of time-steps over many
realisations at a range of model parameter values, on various network
topologies, including random (Erdos-Renyi), small world (Watts-Strogatz) and
(Newman's) highly clustered, community-based networks. An analytical and
probabilistic approach has been developed to account for the observed
behaviour, which explains the results of the numerical calculations.

complementary to a full semantic analysis. The most outstanding outcome is the
difference between the network obtained considering publicly exchanged messages

the network is very homogeneous, in the sense that each individual interacts in
the same way with all the participants, whilst in the latter the interactions
among different agents are very heterogeneous, and are based on \"the enemy of

to enable temporal and evolutionary queries and analysis. We present the design
and architecture of a distributed graph database system that stores the entire
history of a network and provides support for efficient retrieval of multiple
graphs from arbitrary time points in the past, in addition to maintaining the
current state for ongoing updates. Our system exposes a general programmatic
API to process and analyze the retrieved snapshots. We introduce DeltaGraph, a
novel, extensible, highly tunable, and distributed hierarchical index structure
that enables compactly recording the historical information, and that supports
efficient retrieval of historical graph snapshots for single-site or parallel
processing. Along with the original graph data, DeltaGraph can also maintain
and index auxiliary information; this functionality can be used to extend the
structure to efficiently execute queries like subgraph pattern matching over
historical data. We develop analytical models for both the storage space needed
and the snapshot retrieval times to aid in choosing the right parameters for a
specific scenario. In addition, we present strategies for materializing
portions of the historical graph state in memory to further speed up the
retrieval process. Secondly, we present an in-memory graph data structure
called GraphPool that can maintain hundreds of historical graph instances in
main memory in a non-redundant manner. We present a comprehensive experimental
evaluation that illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed techniques at

field of graph data mining due to its importance in many fields such as
biology, social networks or network traffic analysis. The metrics proposed to
shape communities are generic and follow two approaches: maximizing the
internal density of such communities or reducing the connectivity of the
internal vertices with those outside the community. However, these metrics take
the edges as a set and do not consider the internal layout of the edges in the
community. We define a set of properties oriented to social networks that
ensure that communities are cohesive, structured and well defined. Then, we
propose the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC), which is a community metric
based on triangles. We proof that analyzing communities by triangles gives
communities that fulfill the listed set of properties, in contrast to previous
metrics. Finally, we experimentally show that WCC correctly captures the
concept of community in social networks using real and syntethic datasets, and
compare statistically some of the most relevant community detection algorithms

a 1-to-all communication. We propose several new efficient distributed

Additionally, we evaluate average performance of this protocols by simulations
on two classes of generated networks - uniform and social - and compare the
results with performance of exponential backoff heuristic. Ours is the first
provably efficient and well-scalable distributed solution for the (global)
broadcast task. The second randomized protocol developed in this paper does not

has traditionally been deployed over tightly-coupled clusters where the data is
already locally available. The assumption that the data and compute resources
are available in a single central location, however, no longer holds for many
emerging applications in commercial, scientific and social networking domains,
where the data is generated in a geographically distributed manner. Further,
the computational resources needed for carrying out the data analysis may be
distributed across multiple data centers or community resources such as Grids.
In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to capture MapReduce execution
in a highly distributed environment comprising distributed data sources and
distributed computational resources. This framework is flexible enough to
capture several design choices and performance optimizations for MapReduce
execution. We propose a model-driven optimization that has two key features:
(i) it is end-to-end as opposed to myopic optimizations that may only make
locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions, and (ii) it can control
multiple MapReduce phases to achieve low runtime, as opposed to single-phase
optimizations that may control only individual phases. Our model results show
that our optimization can provide nearly 82% and 64% reduction in execution
time over myopic and single-phase optimizations, respectively. We have modified
Hadoop to implement our model outputs, and using three different MapReduce
applications over an 8-node emulated PlanetLab testbed, we show that our
optimized Hadoop execution plan achieves 31-41% reduction in runtime over a
vanilla Hadoop execution. Our model-driven optimization also provides several
insights into the choice of techniques and execution parameters based on
application and platform characteristics.

hoc and OLAP queries, as well as iterative algorithms that analyze data
relationships (e.g., link analysis, clustering, learning). Modern DBMSs support
ad hoc and OLAP queries, but most are not robust enough to scale to large
clusters. Conversely, \"cloud\" platforms like MapReduce execute chains of batch
tasks across clusters in a fault tolerant way, but have too much overhead to
support ad hoc queries.
  Moreover, both classes of platform incur significant overhead in executing
iterative data analysis algorithms. Most such iterative algorithms repeatedly
refine portions of their answers, until some convergence criterion is reached.
However, general cloud platforms typically must reprocess all data in each
step. DBMSs that support recursive SQL are more efficient in that they
propagate only the changes in each step -- but they still accumulate each
iteration's state, even if it is no longer useful. User-defined functions are
also typically harder to write for DBMSs than for cloud platforms.
  We seek to unify the strengths of both styles of platforms, with a focus on
supporting iterative computations in which changes, in the form of deltas, are
propagated from iteration to iteration, and state is efficiently updated in an
extensible way. We present a programming model oriented around deltas, describe
how we execute and optimize such programs in our REX runtime system, and
validate that our platform also handles failures gracefully. We experimentally
validate our techniques, and show speedups over the competing methods ranging

the problem of inferring information - or patterns in general - about events

that it is possible to extract valuable information about social phenomena,

Machine Learning methods. An important intermediate task regards the formation
and identification of features which characterise a target event; we select and
use those textual features in several linear, non-linear and hybrid inference
approaches achieving a significantly good performance in terms of the applied
loss function. By examining further this rich data set, we also propose methods
for extracting various types of mood signals revealing how affective norms - at
least within the social web's population - evolve during the day and how
significant events emerging in the real world are influencing them. Lastly, we
present some preliminary findings showing several spatiotemporal
characteristics of this textual information as well as the potential of using

that is based on measuring the overlap of researchers between areas. It is
found that closely related areas have a high propensity to share a larger
number of common authors. A methodology for comparing areas of vastly different
sizes and to handle name homonymy is constructed, allowing for the robust
deployment of this method on real data sets. A statistical analysis of the
probability distributions of the common author overlap that accounts for noise
is carried out along with the production of network maps with weighted links
proportional to the overlap strength. This is demonstrated on two case studies,
complexity science and neutrino physics, where the level of relatedness of
areas within each area is expected to vary greatly. It is found that the
results returned by this method closely match the intuitive expectation that
the broad, multidisciplinary area of complexity science possesses areas that
are weakly related to each other while the much narrower area of neutrino
physics shows very strongly related areas.

fully local influence, where myopic agents decide their actions after they
interact with other agents that are adjacent to them. For example, in the case
of social interactions, this includes family, friends, and other strong social
ties. The model proposed in this contribution, embodies a global influence as
well where, by global, we mean that each node also observes a sample of the
average behavior of the entire population (in the social example, people
observe other people on the streets, subway, and other social venues). We
consider a case where nodes have dichotomous states (examples include elections
with two major parties, whether or not to adopt a new technology or product,
and any yes/no opinion such as in voting on a referendum). The dynamics of
states on a network with arbitrary degree distribution are studied. For a given
initial condition, we find the probability to reach consensus on each state and
the expected time reach to consensus. The effect of an exogenous bias on the
average orientation of the system is investigated, to model mass media. To do
so, we add an external field to the model that favors one of the states over
the other. This field interferes with the regular decision process of each node
and creates a constant probability to lean towards one of the states. We solve
for the average state of the system as a function of time for given initial
conditions. Then anti-conformists (stubborn nodes who never revise their
states) are added to the network, in an effort to circumvent the external bias.
We find necessary conditions on the number of these defiant nodes required to
cancel the effect of the external bias. Our analysis is based on a mean field
approximation of the agent opinions.

mutual links. Reciprocity has dramatic effects on every networks dynamical
processes and the emergence of structures like motifs and communities. The
binary reciprocity has been extensively studied: that of weighted networks is
still poorly understood. We introduce a general approach to it, by defining
quantities capturing the observed patterns (from dyad-specific to
vertex-specific and network-wide) and introducing analytically solved models

measures based on the similarity of the mutual links-weights are uninformative.
By contrast, our measures can classify different weighted networks, track the

  Sensitivity","  We introduce the notion of restricted sensitivity as an alternative to global
and smooth sensitivity to improve accuracy in differentially private data
analysis. The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global
sensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we
take advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to
quantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and
a hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to
transform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets
including those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of
the query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in
H) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be
inaccurate.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of
answering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of
a graph and a labeling of its vertices. In particular, while our generic
procedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as
graphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using
different projection-based techniques. We then analyze two important query
classes: subgraph counting queries (e.g., number of triangles) and local
profile queries (e.g., number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist
who know each other). We demonstrate that the restricted sensitivity of such
queries can be significantly lower than their smooth sensitivity. Thus, using
restricted sensitivity we can maintain privacy whether or not D is in H, while
providing more accurate results in the event that H holds true.

  To address this challenge, we propose PIRATTE, an architecture that supports
fine-grained access control policies and dynamic group membership. PIRATTE is
built using attribute-based encryption; a key and novel feature of our
architecture, however, is that it is possible to remove access from a user
without issuing new keys to other users or re-encrypting existing ciphertexts.
We achieve this by introducing a proxy that participates in the decryption
process and enforces revocation constraints. The proxy is minimally trusted and
cannot decrypt ciphertexts or provide access to previously revoked users. We
describe the PIRATTE construction and provide a security analysis along with
performance evaluation.We also describe an architecture for online social

  Batsmen and Bowlers","  Quantifying individual performance in the game of Cricket is critical for
team selection in International matches. The number runs scored by batsmen and
wickets taken by bowlers serves as a natural way of quantifying the performance
of a cricketer. Traditionally the batsmen and bowlers are rated on their
batting or bowling average respectively. However in a game like Cricket it is
always important the manner in which one scores the runs or claims a wicket.
Scoring runs against a strong bowling line-up or delivering a brilliant
performance against a team with strong batting line-up deserves more credit. A
player's average is not able to capture this aspect of the game. In this paper
we present a refined method to quantify the `quality' of runs scored by a
batsman or wickets taken by a bowler. We explore the application of Social
Network Analysis (SNA) to rate the players in a team performance. We generate
directed and weighted network of batsmen-bowlers using the player-vs-player
information available for Test cricket and ODI cricket. Additionally we
generate network of batsmen and bowlers based on the dismissal record of
batsmen in the history of cricket - Test (1877-2011) and ODI (1971-2011). Our
results show that {\it M Muralitharan} is the most successful bowler in history
of Cricket. Our approach could potentially be applied in domestic matches to
judge a player's performance which in turn pave the way for a balanced team

  ranking","  Community detection helps us simplify the complex configuration of networks,
but communities are reliable only if they are statistically significant. To
detect statistically significant communities, a common approach is to resample
the original network and analyze the communities. But resampling assumes
independence between samples, while the components of a network are inherently
dependent. Therefore, we must understand how breaking dependencies between
resampled components affects the results of the significance analysis. Here we
use scientific communication as a model system to analyze this effect. Our
dataset includes citations among articles published in journals in the years
1984-2010. We compare parametric resampling of citations with non-parametric
article resampling. While citation resampling breaks link dependencies, article
resampling maintains such dependencies. We find that citation resampling
underestimates the variance of link weights. Moreover, this underestimation
explains most of the differences in the significance analysis of ranking and
clustering. Therefore, when only link weights are available and article
resampling is not an option, we suggest a simple parametric resampling scheme
that generates link-weight variances close to the link-weight variances of
article resampling. Nevertheless, when we highlight and summarize important
structural changes in science, the more dependencies we can maintain in the
resampling scheme, the earlier we can predict structural change.

quickly developing in a markable way due to the increasing amount of data from
real systems and to the fruitful application of powerful methods used in
statistical physics. Many important characteristics of social or biological
systems can be described by the study of their underlying structure of
interactions. Hierarchy is one of these features that can be formulated in the
language of networks. In this paper we present some (qualitative) analytic
results on the hierarchical properties of random network models with zero
correlations and also investigate, mainly numerically, the effects of different
type of correlations. The behavior of hierarchy is different in the absence and
the presence of the giant components. We show that the hierarchical structure
can be drastically different if there are one-point correlations in the
network. We also show numerical results suggesting that hierarchy does not

  events","  Quantities with right-skewed distributions are ubiquitous in complex social
systems, including political conflict, economics and social networks, and these
systems sometimes produce extremely large events. For instance, the 9/11
terrorist events produced nearly 3000 fatalities, nearly six times more than
the next largest event. But, was this enormous loss of life statistically
unlikely given modern terrorism's historical record? Accurately estimating the
probability of such an event is complicated by the large fluctuations in the
empirical distribution's upper tail. We present a generic statistical algorithm
for making such estimates, which combines semi-parametric models of tail
behavior and a nonparametric bootstrap. Applied to a global database of
terrorist events, we estimate the worldwide historical probability of observing
at least one 9/11-sized or larger event since 1968 to be 11-35%. These results
are robust to conditioning on global variations in economic development,
domestic versus international events, the type of weapon used and a truncated
history that stops at 1998. We then use this procedure to make a data-driven
statistical forecast of at least one similar event over the next decade.

structural properties of the network over which they propagate. For a wide
variety of spreading processes, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix
of the network plays a key role on their global dynamical behavior. For many
real-world large-scale networks, it is unfeasible to exactly retrieve the
complete network structure to compute its largest eigenvalue. Instead, one
usually have access to myopic, egocentric views of the network structure, also
called egonets. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework, based on
algebraic graph theory and convex optimization, to study how local structural
properties of the network constrain the interval of possible values in which
the largest eigenvalue must lie. Based on this framework, we present a
computationally efficient approach to find this interval from a collection of
egonets. Our numerical simulations show that, for several social and
communication networks, local structural properties of the network strongly
constrain the location of the largest eigenvalue and the resulting spreading
dynamics. From a practical point of view, our results can be used to dictate
immunization strategies to tame the spreading of a virus, or to design network
topologies that facilitate the spreading of information virally.

  importance of species in ecosystems","  To better understand and manage complex systems like ecosystems it is
critical to know the relative contribution of system components to system
functioning. Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that
individuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this
research area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter
entering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative
contribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global
because it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.
Further, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social
science. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists
to use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,
I characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic
ecosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a
small fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the
system activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes
generate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant
nodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the
130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary
producers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality
indicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power
concentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these
results are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis
based on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be
useful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban
metabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.

and defenses against Sybil attacks. Several recent results suggest that
augmenting the social network structure with user attributes (e.g., location,
employer, communities of interest) can provide a more fine-grained
understanding of social networks. However, there have been few studies to
provide a systematic understanding of these effects at scale. We bridge this
gap using a unique dataset collected as the Google+ social network grew over

respect to both standard social network metrics and new attribute-related
metrics (that we define). We also observe interesting evolutionary patterns as
Google+ went from a bootstrap phase to a steady invitation-only stage before a

our model can accurately reproduce the social and attribute structure of real

-Q0, where Qf is the intracluster edge fraction of G and Q0 is the expected
intracluster edge fraction of the null model, i.e., a randomly connected graph
with same expected degree distribution as G. It follows that the maximization
of QN must accomodate two factors pulling in opposite directions: Qf favors a
small number of clusters and Q0 favors many balanced (i.e., with approximately
equal degrees) clusters. In certain cases the Q0 term can cause overestimation
of the true cluster number; this is the opposite of the well-known under
estimation effect caused by the \"resolution limit\" of modularity. We illustrate
the overestimation effect by constructing families of graphs with a \"natural\"
community structure which, however, does not maximize modularity. In fact, we
prove that we can always find a graph G with a \"natural clustering\" V of G and
another, balanced clustering U of G such that (i) the pair (G; U) has higher

random walk may not be appropriate for modeling social phenomena, including
epidemics and information diffusion, in which one node may interact with many
others at the same time, for example, by broadcasting the virus or information

algorithms have to take into account the nature of interactions between the

non-conservative and relate them to well-known measures of centrality used in
network analysis: PageRank and Alpha-Centrality. We demonstrate, by ranking
users in online social networks used for broadcasting information, that
non-conservative Alpha-Centrality generally leads to a better agreement with an

centered on the concept of a triad, which is a subgraph of three nodes. Such
methods are often applied in the social sciences as well as many other diverse
fields. Triadic methods commonly operate on a triad census that counts the
number of triads of every possible edge configuration in a graph. Like other
graph algorithms, triadic census algorithms do not scale well when graphs reach
tens of millions to billions of nodes. To enable the triadic analysis of
large-scale graphs, we developed and optimized a triad census algorithm to
efficiently execute on shared memory architectures. We then conducted
performance evaluations of the parallel triad census algorithm on three
specific systems: Cray XMT, HP Superdome, and AMD multi-core NUMA machine.
These three systems have shared memory architectures but with markedly
different hardware capabilities to manage parallelism.

confirm that large social networks evolve through both network and

Network description and analysis not only give a systems-level understanding of
drug action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency

network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity,
protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction

propose that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The central hit
strategy selectively targets central nodes/edges of the flexible networks of
infectious agents or cancer cells to kill them. The network influence strategy
works against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid
networks needs to be achieved by targeting the neighbors of central nodes or
edges. It is shown how network techniques can help in the identification of
single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug target candidates.
We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit identification, lead
selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing side-effects and drug
toxicity. Successful network-based drug development strategies are shown
through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic diseases,
neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing more than 1200 references we
suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a
list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight
network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a

  Revolution","  The self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17, 2011 in the small
Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid, set off a sequence of events culminating in the
revolutions of the Arab Spring. It is widely believed that the Internet and
social media played a critical role in the growth and success of protests that
led to the downfall of the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. However, the precise
mechanisms by which these new media affected the course of events remain
unclear. We introduce a simple compartmental model for the dynamics of a
revolution in a dictatorial regime such as Tunisia or Egypt which takes into
account the role of the Internet and social media. An elementary mathematical
analysis of the model identifies four main parameter regions: stable police
state, meta-stable police state, unstable police state, and failed state. We
illustrate how these regions capture, at least qualitatively, a wide range of
scenarios observed in the context of revolutionary movements by considering the
revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as the situation in Iran, China, and
Somalia, as case studies. We pose four questions about the dynamics of the Arab
Spring revolutions and formulate answers informed by the model. We conclude
with some possible directions for future work.

gives consideration to both the topology and the functions (background

  with the Core & Peel algorithm","  Detecting and characterizing dense subgraphs (tight communities) in social
and information networks is an important exploratory tool in social network
analysis. Several approaches have been proposed that either (i) partition the
whole network into clusters, even in low density region, or (ii) are aimed at
finding a single densest community (and need to be iterated to find the next
one). As social networks grow larger both approaches (i) and (ii) result in
algorithms too slow to be practical, in particular when speed in analyzing the
data is required. In this paper we propose an approach that aims at balancing
efficiency of computation and expressiveness and manageability of the output
community representation. We define the notion of a partial dense cover (PDC)
of a graph. Intuitively a PDC of a graph is a collection of sets of nodes that
(a) each set forms a disjoint dense induced subgraphs and (b) its removal
leaves the residual graph without dense regions. Exact computation of PDC is an
NP-complete problem, thus, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithms for
computing a PDC which we christen Core and Peel. Moreover we propose a novel
benchmarking technique that allows us to evaluate algorithms for computing PDC
using the classical IR concepts of precision and recall even without a golden
standard. Tests on 25 social and technological networks from the Stanford Large
Network Dataset Collection confirm that Core and Peel is efficient and attains
very high precison and recall.

factors to be included in any theoretical model whose aim is the quantification
of the trade between countries. Quantitatively, distances enter into the
so-called gravity models that successfully predict the weight of non-zero trade
flows. However, it has been recently shown that gravity models fail to
reproduce the binary topology of the World Trade Web. In this paper a different
approach is presented: the formalism of exponential random graphs is used and
the distances are treated as constraints, to be imposed on a previously chosen
ensemble of graphs. Then, the information encoded in the geographical distances
is used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web, by testing it
on the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure. This leads to
the definition of a novel null model that combines spatial and non-spatial
effects. The effectiveness of spatial constraints is compared to that of
nonspatial ones by means of the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian
Information Criterion. Even if it is commonly believed that the World Trade Web
is strongly dependent on the distances, what emerges from our analysis is that
distances do not play a crucial role in shaping the World Trade Web binary
structure and that the information encoded into the reciprocity is far more
useful in explaining the observed patterns.

community detection on networks. We analyze an algorithm that we call
\textsc{Max-LPA}, both in terms of its convergence time and in terms of the
\"quality\" of the communities detected. \textsc{Max-LPA} is an instance of a
class of community detection algorithms called \textit{label propagation}
algorithms. As far as we know, most analysis of label propagation algorithms
thus far has been empirical in nature and in this paper we seek a theoretical
understanding of label propagation algorithms. In our main result, we define a
clustered version of \er random graphs with clusters $V_1, V_2,..., V_k$ where
the probability $p$, of an edge connecting nodes within a cluster $V_i$ is
higher than $p'$, the probability of an edge connecting nodes in distinct
clusters. We show that even with fairly general restrictions on $p$ and $p'$
($p = \Omega(\frac{1}{n^{1/4-\epsilon}})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$, $p' =
O(p^2)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes), \textsc{Max-LPA} detects the
clusters $V_1, V_2,..., V_n$ in just two rounds. Based on this and on empirical
results, we conjecture that \textsc{Max-LPA} can correctly and quickly identify
communities on clustered \er graphs even when the clusters are much sparser,
i.e., with $p = \frac{c\log n}{n}$ for some $c > 1$.

  the null model","  Modularity is a widely used measure for evaluating community structure in
networks. The definition of modularity involves a comparison of
within-community edges in the observed network and that number in an equivalent
randomized network. This equivalent randomized network is called the null
model, which serves as a reference. To make the comparison significant, the
null model should characterize some features of the observed network. However,
the null model in the original definition of modularity is unrealistically
mixed, in the sense that any node can be linked to any other node without
preference and only connectivity matters. Thus, it fails to be a good
representation of real-world networks. A common feature of many real-world
networks is \"similarity attraction\", i.e., edges tend to link to nodes that are
similar to each other. We propose a null model that captures the similarity
attraction feature. This null model enables us to create a framework for
defining a family of Dist-Modularity adapted to various networks, including
networks with additional information on nodes. We demonstrate that
Dist-Modularity is useful in identifying communities at different scales.

natural graph or network structure data, such as social network analysis and
relational learning, many other applications often involve a critical step in
converting data vectors to an adjacency graph. In particular, a sparse subgraph
extracted from the original graph is often required due to both theoretic and

sparse subgraphs with balanced node connectivity. However, the existing graph
construction methods are either computationally expensive or with
unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we utilize a scalable method called

which probably reflect stable a priori attitudes toward the law. We find that
U. S. Supreme Court justice votes are more predictable than one would expect
from an ideal court composed of perfectly independent justices. Deviations from
ideal behavior are most apparent in divided 5-4 decisions, where justice blocks
seem to be most stable. Moreover, we find evidence that justice predictability
decreased during the 50-year period spanning from the Warren Court to the
Rehnquist Court, and that aggregate court predictability has been significantly
lower during Democratic presidencies. More broadly, our results show that it is
possible to use methods developed for the analysis of complex social networks
to quantitatively investigate historical questions related to political
decision-making.

ability for technically naive users to compose computational elements into
novel configurations. Examples include astronomers who create new analysis
pipelines to process telescopic data, intelligence analysts who must process
diverse sources of unstructured text to discover socio-technical trends, and
medical researchers who have to process brain image data in new ways to
understand disease pathways. Creating such compositions today typically
requires low-level technical expertise, limiting the use of computational
methods and increasing the cost of using them. In this paper we describe an
approach - which we term end-user architecting - that exploits the similarity
between such compositional activities and those of software architects. Drawing
on the rich heritage of software architecture languages, methods, and tools, we
show how those techniques can be adapted to support end users in composing rich
computational systems through domain-specific compositional paradigms and
component repositories, without requiring that they have knowledge of the
low-level implementation details of the components or the compositional
infrastructure. Further, we outline a set of open research challenges that the

life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human
interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we
map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European
countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total
communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according
to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase
that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that
an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely
unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant
acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger,
which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the
studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards
understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities
with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for
instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain
contagious diseases.

contagion in the recent financial crisis. We develop a network approach to the
amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping
portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a
generalized branching process. By studying a stylized model we estimate the
circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a
function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and
market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual
institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result
financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. Under our model
there is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are
always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases.
The financial system exhibits \"robust yet fragile\" behavior, with regions of
the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it
occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and
provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing.

users or individuals at high risk of being infected with HIV. The mechanism is
to find initial participants (seeds), and give each of them a fixed number of
coupons allowing them to recruit people they know from the population of
interest, with a mutual financial incentive. The new participants are given
coupons again and the process repeats. Currently, the standard RDS estimator

threat that the global trade networks could spread fatal pathogens. The global
trade network is a typical overlay network, which compounds multiple standalone
trade networks representing the transmission of a single product and connecting
the same set of countries and territories through their own set of trade
interactions. Although the epidemic dynamic implications of overlay networks
have been debated in recent studies, some general answers for the overlay of
multiple and diverse standalone networks remain elusive, especially the
relationship between the heterogeneity and diversity of a set of standalone
networks and the behavior of the overlay network. In this paper, we establish a
general analysis framework for multiple overlay networks based on diversity
theory. The framework could reveal the critical epidemic mechanisms beyond
overlay processes. Applying the framework to global trade networks, we found
that, although the distribution of connectivity of standalone trade networks
was highly heterogeneous, epidemic behavior on overlay networks is more
dependent on cooperation among standalone trade networks rather than on a few
high-connectivity networks as the general property of complex systems with
heterogeneous distribution. Moreover, the analysis of overlay trade networks
related to 7 real pathogens also suggested that epidemic behavior is not
controlled by high-connectivity goods but that the actual compound mode of
overlay trade networks plays a critical role in spreading pathogens. Finally,
we study the influence of cooperation mechanisms on the stability of overlay
networks and on the control of global epidemics. The framework provides a
general tool to study different problems on overlay networks.

activity in society today is one of the cornerstones of the social sciences. In
financial economics, the key issue in this regard is understanding and
quantifying how news of all possible types (geopolitical, environmental,
social, financial, economic, etc.) affect trading and the pricing of firms in
organized stock markets. In this article, we seek to address this issue by
performing an analysis of more than 24 million news records provided by
Thompson Reuters and of their relationship with trading activity for 206 major
stocks in the S&P US stock index. We show that the whole landscape of news that
affect stock price movements can be automatically summarized via simple
regularized regressions between trading activity and news information pieces
decomposed, with the help of simple topic modeling techniques, into their
\"thematic\" features. Using these methods, we are able to estimate and quantify
the impacts of news on trading. We introduce network-based visualization
techniques to represent the whole landscape of news information associated with
a basket of stocks. The examination of the words that are representative of the
topic distributions confirms that our method is able to extract the significant
pieces of information influencing the stock market. Our results show that one
of the most puzzling stylized fact in financial economies, namely that at
certain times trading volumes appear to be \"abnormally large,\" can be partially
explained by the flow of news. In this sense, our results prove that there is
no \"excess trading,\" when restricting to times when news are genuinely novel

the structure and robustness of complex biological and social systems. While
arguments for the link between specialization and productivity are common,
diversity has often been invoked as a hedging strategy, allowing systems to
evolve in response to environmental change. Despite their general appeal, these
arguments have not typically produced quantitative predictions for optimal
levels of functional diversity consistent with observations. One important
reason why these relationships have resisted formalization is the idiosyncratic
nature of diversity measures, which depend on given classification schemes.
Here, we address these issues by analyzing the statistics of professions in
cities and show how their probability distribution takes a universal
scale-invariant form, common to all cities, obtained in the limit of infinite
resolution of given taxonomies. We propose a model that generates the form and
parameters of this distribution via the introduction of new occupations at a
rate leading to individual specialization subject to the preservation of access
to overall function via their ego social networks. This perspective unifies
ideas about the importance of network structure in ecology and of innovation as
a recombinatory process with economic concepts of productivity gains obtained
through the division and coordination of labor, stimulated by scale.

simple and general graph model made of nodes (representing individuals) and
ties. However, when we focus on our daily on-line experience we must confront a
more complex scenario: people inhabitate several on-line spaces interacting to
several communities active on various technological infrastructures like
Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or FourSquare and with distinct social objectives.
This constitutes a complex network of interconnected networks where users'
identities are spread and where information propagates navigating through
different communities and social platforms. In this article we introduce a
model for this layered scenario that we call multi-stratum network. Through a
theoretical discussion and the analysis of real-world data we show how not only
focusing on a single network may provide a very partial understanding of the

  outbreaks","  Social network analysis is now widely used to investigate the dynamics of
infectious disease spread from person to person. Vaccination dramatically
disrupts the disease transmission process on a contact network, and indeed,
sufficiently high vaccination rates can disrupt the process to such an extent
that disease transmission on the network is effectively halted. Here, we build
on mounting evidence that health behaviors - such as vaccination, and refusal
thereof - can spread through social networks through a process of complex
contagion that requires social reinforcement. Using network simulations that
model both the health behavior and the infectious disease spread, we find that
under otherwise identical conditions, the process by which the health behavior
spreads has a very strong effect on disease outbreak dynamics. This variability
in dynamics results from differences in the topology within susceptible
communities that arise during the health behavior spreading process, which in
turn depends on the topology of the overall social network. Our findings point
to the importance of health behavior spread in predicting and controlling
disease outbreaks.

deterministic binary linear threshold model. Our starting point is a networked
coordination game where each agent's payoff is the sum of the payoffs coming
from pairwise interactions with each of the neighbors. We first establish that
the best response dynamics in this networked game is equivalent to the linear
threshold dynamics with heterogeneous thresholds over the agents. While the
previous literature has studied such linear threshold models under the
assumption that each agent may change actions at most once, a study of best
response dynamics in such networked games necessitates an analysis that allows
for multiple switches in actions. In this paper, we develop such an analysis
and construct a combinatorial framework to understand the behavior of the
model. To this end, we establish that the agents behavior cycles among
different actions in the limit and provide three sets of results.
  We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We
determine the length of the limit cycles and reveal bounds on the time steps
required to reach such cycles for different network structures. We then study
the complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context.
Specifically, we consider the tractability of counting the number of limit
cycles and fixed-points, and deciding the reachability of action profiles. We
finally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the
involved dynamics. We prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different
network structures under this measure.

email and social networks. As the industry matures, there are many questions
regarding the impact of daily deals on the marketplace. Important questions in
this regard concern the reasons why businesses decide to offer daily deals and
their longer-term impact on businesses. In the present paper, we investigate
whether the unobserved factors that make marketers run daily deals are
correlated with the unobserved factors that influence the business, In
particular, we employ the framework of seemingly unrelated regression to model
the correlation between the errors in predicting whether a business uses a
daily deal and the errors in predicting the business' survival. Our analysis
consists of the survival of 985 small businesses that offered daily deals
between January and July 2011 in the city of Chicago. Our results indicate that
there is a statistically significant correlation between the unobserved factors
that influence the business' decision to offer a daily deal and the unobserved
factors that impact its survival. Furthermore, our results indicate that the
correlation coefficient is significant in certain business categories (e.g.
restaurants).

collected the entire Tencent Weibo from 10th, Oct, 2011 to 5th, Jan, 2012 and
obtained 320 million user profiles, 5.15 billion user actions. We study Tencent
Weibo from both macro and micro levels. From the macro level, Tencent users are
more active on forwarding messages, but with less reciprocal relationships than
Twitter users, their topic preferences are very different from Twitter users
from both content and time consuming; besides, information can be diffused more
efficient in Tencent Weibo. From the micro level, we mainly evaluate users'
social influence from two indexes: \"Forward\" and \Follower\", we study how
users' actions will contribute to their social influences, and further identify
unique features of Tencent users. According to our studies, Tencent users'
actions are more personalized and diversity, and the influential users play a
more important part in the whole networks. Based on the above analysis, we

the constraint on total travelling cost, this aggregated scaling law can be
analytically predicted by the mixture nature of human travel under the

biological networks. Since many real-world networks are massive in size,
continuously evolving, and/or distributed in nature, the network structure is
often sampled in order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough
and complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support the field
of network science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general
problem of network sampling, by highlighting the different objectives,
population and units of interest, and classes of network sampling methods. In
addition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling
methods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption
of a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for
streaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on the concept
of graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational
models (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the
topological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
traditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for
each of the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and
topology-based sampling. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed
family of sampling methods more accurately preserves the underlying properties
of the graph for both static and streaming graphs. Finally, we study the impact
of network sampling algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance
evaluation of relational classification algorithms.

  Changing Random Networks","  Modeling spreading processes in complex random networks plays an essential
role in understanding and prediction of many real phenomena like epidemics or
rumor spreading. The dynamics of such systems may be represented
algorithmically by Monte-Carlo simulations on graphs or by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Despite many results in the area of network
modeling the selection of the best computational representation of the model
dynamics remains a challenge. While a closed form description is often
straightforward to derive, it generally cannot be solved analytically; as a
consequence the network dynamics requires a numerical solution of the ODEs or a
direct Monte-Carlo simulation on the networks. Moreover, Monte-Carlo
simulations and ODE solutions are not equivalent since ODEs produce a
deterministic solution while Monte-Carlo simulations are stochastic by nature.
Despite some recent advantages in Monte-Carlo simulations, particularly in the
flexibility of implementation, the computational cost of an ODE solution is
much lower and supports accurate and detailed output analysis such as
uncertainty or sensitivity analyses, parameter identification etc. In this
paper we propose a novel approach to model spreading processes in complex
random heterogeneous networks using systems of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations. We successfully apply this approach to predict the dynamics of
HIV-AIDS spreading in sexual networks, and compare it to historical data.

community labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to
estimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM)
is a popular network model. How to detect communities with the DCBM is an
interesting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity.
We propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral
Clustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE). Compared to classical spectral
methods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first
leading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering.
Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the $K$ leading
eigenvectors of $A$, say, $\hat{\eta}_1,\ldots,\hat{\eta}_K$, and let $\hat{R}$
be the $n\times (K-1)$ matrix such that
$\hat{R}(i,k)=\hat{\eta}_{k+1}(i)/\hat{\eta}_1(i)$, $1\leq i\leq n$, $1\leq
k\leq K-1$. We then use $\hat{R}$ for clustering by applying the $k$-means
method. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely
ancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between
$\hat{\eta}_{k+1}$ and $\hat{\eta}_1$, $1\leq k\leq K-1$. The method is
successfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error
rates of $58/1222$ and $1/34$, respectively. These results are more
satisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally,
compared to modularity methods, SCORE is easier to implement, computationally
faster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework
where we show that under mild conditions, the SCORE stably yields consistent
community detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on
Random Matrix Theory (RMT), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is
especially helpful.

  Network","  Power law distribution is common in real-world networks including online
social networks. Many studies on complex networks focus on the characteristics
of vertices, which are always proved to follow the power law. However, few
researches have been done on edges in directed networks. In this paper, edge
balance ratio is firstly proposed to measure the balance property of edges in
directed networks. Based on edge balance ratio, balance profile and positivity
are put forward to describe the balance level of the whole network. Then the
distribution of edge balance ratio is theoretically analyzed. In a directed
network whose vertex in-degree follows the power law with scaling exponent
$\gamma$, it is proved that the edge balance ratio follows a piecewise power
law, with the scaling exponent of each section linearly dependents on $\gamma$.
The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the
theoretical analysis is confirmed by statistics of real-world online social

  Segmentation","  Because networks can be used to represent many complex systems, they have
attracted considerable attention in physics, computer science, sociology, and
many other disciplines. One of the most important areas of network science is
the algorithmic detection of cohesive groups (i.e., \"communities\") of nodes. In
this paper, we algorithmically detect communities in social networks and image
data by optimizing multislice modularity. A key advantage of modularity
optimization is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number or sizes
of communities, and it is capable of finding network partitions that are
composed of communities of different sizes. By optimizing multislice modularity
and subsequently calculating diagnostics on the resulting network partitions,
it is thereby possible to obtain information about network structure across
multiple system scales. We illustrate this method on data from both social
networks and images, and we find that optimization of multislice modularity
performs well on these two tasks without the need for extensive
problem-specific adaptation. However, improving the computational speed of this
method remains a challenging open problem.

of dynamic networks discretize time by converting temporal information into a
sequence of network \"snapshots\" for further analysis. Here we study a highly
resolved data set of a dynamic proximity network of 66 individuals. We show
that the topology of this network evolves over a very broad distribution of
time scales, that its behavior is characterized by strong periodicities driven
by external calendar cycles, and that the conversion of inherently
continuous-time data into a sequence of snapshots can produce highly biased
estimates of network structure. We suggest that dynamic social networks exhibit
a natural time scale \Delta_{nat}, and that the best conversion of such dynamic

information in graph structures for the purpose of community discovery, a
fundamental task in network analysis. Our approach hinges on the basic
intuition that many networks contain noise in the link structure and that
content information can help strengthen the community signal. This enables ones
to eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and false negatives), which
is particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scale information
networks.
  Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between two nodes in
the network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link
strength is estimated based on whether the link is likely (with high
probability) to reside within a community. Content similarity is estimated
through cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient. We discuss a simple mechanism
for fusing content and link similarity. We then present a biased edge sampling
procedure which retains edges that are locally relevant for each graph node.
The resulting backbone graph can be clustered using standard community
discovery algorithms such as Metis and Markov clustering.
  Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets (Flickr,
Wikipedia and CiteSeer) with varying sizes and characteristics, we demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods over state-of-the-art learning
and mining approaches several of which also attempt to combine link and content
analysis for the purposes of community discovery. Specifically we always find a
qualitative benefit when combining content with link analysis. Additionally our
biased graph sampling approach realizes a quantitative benefit in that it is
typically several orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.

  Processing","  This paper explores two separate questions: Can we perform natural language
processing tasks without a lexicon?; and, Should we? Existing natural language
processing techniques are either based on words as units or use units such as
grams only for basic classification tasks. How close can a machine come to
reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without using any
lexicon, based only on grams?
  Our own motivation for posing this question is based on our efforts to find
popular trends in words and phrases from online Chinese social media. This form
of written Chinese uses so many neologisms, creative character placements, and
combinations of writing systems that it has been dubbed the \"Martian Language.\"
Readers must often use visual queues, audible queues from reading out loud, and
their knowledge and understanding of current events to understand a post. For
analysis of popular trends, the specific problem is that it is difficult to
build a lexicon when the invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept is
easy and common. For natural language processing in general, we argue in this
paper that new uses of language in social media will challenge machines'
abilities to operate with words as the basic unit of understanding, not only in
Chinese but potentially in other languages.

dictators who had ruled for decades. While the events have been hailed as an
\"Arab Spring\" by those who hope that repressive autocracies will be replaced by
democracies, what sort of regimes will eventually emerge from the crisis
remains far from certain. Here we provide a complex systems framework,
validated by historical precedent, to help answer this question. We describe
the dynamics of governmental change as an evolutionary process similar to
biological evolution, in which complex organizations gradually arise by
replication, variation and competitive selection. Different kinds of
governments, however, have differing levels of complexity. Democracies must be
more systemically complex than autocracies because of their need to incorporate
large numbers of people in decision-making. This difference has important
implications for the relative robustness of democratic and autocratic
governments after revolutions. Revolutions may disrupt existing evolved
complexity, limiting the potential for building more complex structures
quickly. Insofar as systemic complexity is reduced by revolution, democracy is
harder to create in the wake of unrest than autocracy. Applying this analysis
to the Middle East and North Africa, we infer that in the absence of stable
institutions or external assistance, new governments are in danger of facing
increasingly insurmountable challenges and reverting to autocracy.

networks, which characterizes network operators' service provisions to
delay-sensitive secondary users (SUs) via pricing strategies. Based on the two
paradigms of shared-use and exclusive-use dynamic spectrum access (DSA), we
examine three network scenarios corresponding to three types of secondary
markets. In the first monopoly market with one operator using opportunistic
shared-use DSA, we study the operator's pricing effect on the equilibrium
behaviors of self-optimizing SUs in a queueing system. %This queue represents
the congestion of the multiple SUs sharing the operator's single \ON-\OFF
channel that models the primary users (PUs) traffic. We provide a queueing
delay analysis with the general distributions of the SU service time and PU
traffic using the renewal theory. In terms of SUs, we show that there exists a
unique Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game where SUs are players
employing individual optimal strategies. We also provide a sufficient condition
and iterative algorithms for equilibrium convergence. In terms of operators,
two pricing mechanisms are proposed with different goals: revenue maximization
and social welfare maximization. In the second monopoly market, an operator
exploiting exclusive-use DSA has many channels that will be allocated
separately to each entering SU. We also analyze the pricing effect on the
equilibrium behaviors of the SUs and the revenue-optimal and socially-optimal
pricing strategies of the operator in this market. In the third duopoly market,
we study a price competition between two operators employing shared-use and
exclusive-use DSA, respectively, as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Using a
backward induction method, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium for
this game and investigate the equilibrium convergence.

describing constraints between various nodes, groups can be formed among these
so that the resulting configuration optimizes a \emph{global} metric. In
contrast, for various social and economic networks, groups are formed \emph{de
facto} by the choices of selfish players. A fundamental problem in this setting
is the existence and convergence to a \emph{self-enforcing} configuration:
assignment of players into groups such that no player has an incentive to move
into another group than hers. Motivated by information sharing on social
networks -- and the difficult tradeoff between its benefits and the associated
privacy risk -- we study the possible emergence of such stable configurations
in a general selfish group formation game.
  Our paper considers this general game for the first time, and it completes
its analysis. We show that convergence critically depends on the level of
\emph{collusions} among the players -- which allow multiple players to move
simultaneously as long as \emph{all of them} benefit. Solving a previously open
problem we exactly show when, depending on collusions, convergence occurs
within polynomial time, non-polynomial time, and when it never occurs. We also
prove that previously known bounds on convergence time are all loose: by a
novel combinatorial analysis of the evolution of this game we are able to
provide the first \emph{asymptotically exact} formula on its convergence.
Moreover, we extend these results by providing a complete analysis when groups
may \emph{overlap}, and for general utility functions representing
\emph{multi-modal} interactions. Finally, we prove that collusions have a
significant and \emph{positive} effect on the \emph{efficiency} of the
equilibrium that is attained.

faster speed and the higher proportion of high-speed agents can enhance the

forwarding. A hierarchical structure in the dependence of high-speed is
observed: the network throughput remains unchanged in small and large

theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that the optimal

  Networks: A Spectral Analysis","  In epidemic modeling, the term infection strength indicates the ratio of
infection rate and cure rate. If the infection strength is higher than a
certain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the
epidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a
single generic graph representing the contact network of the population under
consideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of
the spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it
is not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some
interconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact
network. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited
to homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this
paper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a
given network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with
fixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the
interconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph
theory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks.
These results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and
control. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.

networks. In formal mathematical terms, it concerns the distribution of triad
configurations in actual networks compared to random networks of the same edge
density. On reading Charles Kadushin's recent book \"Understanding Social
Networks\", we were struck by the amount of confusion in the presentation of
this concept in the early sections of the book. This confusion seems to lie
behind his flawed analysis of a classical empirical data set, namely the karate
club graph of Zachary. Our goal here is twofold. Firstly, we present the notion
of balance in terms which are logically consistent, but also consistent with
the way sociologists use the term. The main message is that the notion can only
be meaningfully applied to undirected graphs. Secondly, we correct the analysis
of triads in the karate club graph. This results in the interesting observation
that the graph is, in a precise sense, quite \"unbalanced\". We show that this
lack of balance is characteristic of a wide class of starlike-graphs, and
discuss possible sociological interpretations of this fact, which may be useful
in many other situations.

influential individuals -- where $n$ is the campaign budget -- that are able to
cover a large target audience through their social connections. So far most of
the related literature on maximizing this network cover assumes that the social
network topology is known. Even in such a case the optimal solution is NP-hard.
In practice, however, the network topology is generally unknown and needs to be
discovered on-the-fly. In this work we consider an unknown topology where
recruited individuals disclose their social connections (a feature known as
{\em one-hop lookahead}). The goal of this work is to provide an efficient
greedy online algorithm that recruits individuals as to maximize the size of
target audience covered by the campaign.
  We propose a new greedy online algorithm, Maximum Expected $d$-Excess Degree
(MEED), and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first detailed
theoretical analysis of the cover size of a variety of well known network
sampling algorithms on finite networks. Our proposed algorithm greedily
maximizes the expected size of the cover. For a class of random power law
networks we show that MEED simplifies into a straightforward procedure, which
we denote MOD (Maximum Observed Degree). We substantiate our analytical results
with extensive simulations and show that MOD significantly outperforms all
analyzed myopic algorithms. We note that performance may be further improved if
the node degree distribution is known or can be estimated online during the
campaign.

survey worldwide linguistic indicators and trends through the analysis of a
large-scale dataset of microblogging posts. We show that available data allow
for the study of language geography at scales ranging from country-level
aggregation to specific city neighborhoods. The high resolution and coverage of
the data allows us to investigate different indicators such as the linguistic
homogeneity of different countries, the touristic seasonal patterns within
countries and the geographical distribution of different languages in
multilingual regions. This work highlights the potential of geolocalized
studies of open data sources to improve current analysis and develop indicators
for major social phenomena in specific communities.

  the honeybee antennal lobe","  Local computation in microcircuits is an essential feature of distributed
information processing in vertebrate and invertebrate brains. The insect
antennal lobe represents a spatially confined local network that processes
high-dimensional and redundant peripheral input to compute an efficient odor
code. Social insects can rely on a particularly rich olfactory receptor
repertoire and they exhibit complex odor-guided behaviors. This corresponds
with a high anatomical complexity of their AL network. In the honeybee, a large
number of glomeruli that receive sensory input are interconnected by a dense
network of local interneurons (LNs). Uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs)
integrate sensory and recurrent network input into an efficient spatio-temporal
odor code. To investigate the specific computational roles of LNs and PNs we
measured eleven features of sub- and suprathreshold single cell responses to in
vivo odor stimulation. Using a semi-supervised cluster analysis we identified a
combination of five characteristic features that enabled the accurate
separation of morphologically identified LNs and PNs. The two clusters differed
significantly in all five features. In the absence of stimulation PNs showed a
higher subthreshold activation, assumed higher peak response rates and more
regular spiking pattern. LNs reacted considerably faster to the onset of a
stimulus and their responses were more reliable across stimulus repetitions. We
discuss possible mechanisms that can explain our results, and we interpret
cell-type specific characteristics with respect to their functional relevance.

  Power Grid Networks","  Recently, there has been a growing concern about the overload status of the
power grid networks, and the increasing possibility of cascading failures. Many
researchers have studied these networks to provide design guidelines for more
robust power grids. Topological analysis is one of the components of system
analysis for its robustness. This paper presents a complex systems analysis of
power grid networks. First, the cascading effect has been simulated on three
well known networks: the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test
system, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. To extend the analysis to a
larger set of networks, we develop a network generator and generate multiple
graphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE test networks but with
different topologies. The generated graphs are then compared to the test
networks to show the effect of topology in determining their robustness with
respect to cascading failures. The generated graphs turn out to be more robust
than the test graphs, showing the importance of topology in the robust design
of power grids. The second part of this paper concerns the discussion of two
novel mitigation strategies for cascading failures: Targeted Load Reduction and
Islanding using Distributed Sources. These new mitigation strategies are
compared with the Homogeneous Load Reduction strategy. Even though the
Homogeneous Load Reduction is simpler to implement, the Targeted Load Reduction
is much more effective. Additionally, an algorithm is presented for the
partitioning of the network for islanding as an effort towards fault isolation
to prevent cascading failures. The results for island formation are better if
the sources are well distributed, else the algorithm leads to the formation of
superislands.

succeeded in extracting influence from online communities in a satisfactory
way. One of the challenges that limited previous researches is that it is
difficult to capture user behaviors. Consequently, the influence among users
could only be inferred in an indirect and heuristic way, which is inaccurate
and noise-prone. In this study, we conduct an extensive investigation in regard
to influence among bloggers at a Japanese blog web site, BIGLOBE. By processing
the log files of the web servers, we are able to accurately extract the
activities of BIGLOBE members in terms of writing their blog posts and reading
other member's posts. Based on these activities, we propose a principled
framework to detect influence among the members with high confidence level.
From the extracted influence, we conduct in-depth analysis on how influence
varies over different topics and how influence varies over different members.
We also show the potentials of leveraging the extracted influence to make
personalized recommendation in BIGLOBE. To our best knowledge, this is one of
the first studies that capture and analyze influence in the blogosphere in such

censored, missing or otherwise incomplete information. For example, the popular
fixed rank nomination (FRN) scheme, often used in studies of schools and
businesses, asks study participants to nominate and rank at most a small number
of contacts or friends, leaving the existence other relations uncertain.
However, most statistical models are formulated in terms of completely observed
binary networks. Statistical analyses of FRN data with such models ignore the
censored and ranked nature of the data and could potentially result in
misleading statistical inference. To investigate this possibility, we compare
parameter estimates obtained from a likelihood for complete binary networks to
those from a likelihood that is derived from the FRN scheme, and therefore
recognizes the ranked and censored nature of the data. We show analytically and
via simulation that the binary likelihood can provide misleading inference, at
least for certain model parameters that relate network ties to characteristics
of individuals and pairs of individuals. We also compare these different
likelihoods in a data analysis of several adolescent social networks. For some
of these networks, the parameter estimates from the binary and FRN likelihoods
lead to different conclusions, indicating the importance of analyzing FRN data
with a method that accounts for the FRN survey design.

social diffusion processes, for instance to permit early identification of
emerging contentious situations, rapid detection of disease outbreaks, or
accurate forecasting of the ultimate reach of potentially viral ideas or
behaviors. This paper proposes a new approach to this predictive analytics
problem, in which analysis of meso-scale network dynamics is leveraged to
generate useful predictions for complex social phenomena. We begin by deriving
a stochastic hybrid dynamical systems (S-HDS) model for diffusion processes
taking place over social networks with realistic topologies; this modeling
approach is inspired by recent work in biology demonstrating that S-HDS offer a
useful mathematical formalism with which to represent complex, multi-scale
biological network dynamics. We then perform formal stochastic reachability
analysis with this S-HDS model and conclude that the outcomes of social
diffusion processes may depend crucially upon the way the early dynamics of the
process interacts with the underlying network's community structure and
core-periphery structure. This theoretical finding provides the foundations for
developing a machine learning algorithm that enables accurate early warning
analysis for social diffusion events. The utility of the warning algorithm, and
the power of network-based predictive metrics, are demonstrated through an
empirical investigation of the propagation of political memes over social media
networks. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of the approach for
security informatics applications through case studies involving early warning
analysis of large-scale protests events and politically-motivated cyber
attacks.

  Diffusion","  Social scientists have observed that human behavior in society can often be
modeled as corresponding to a threshold type policy. A new behavior would
propagate by a procedure in which an individual adopts the new behavior if the
fraction of his neighbors or friends having adopted the new behavior exceeds
some threshold. In this paper we study the question of whether the emergence of
threshold policies may be modeled as a result of some rational process which
would describe the behavior of non-cooperative rational members of some social
network. We focus on situations in which individuals take the decision whether
to access or not some content, based on the number of views that the content
has. Our analysis aims at understanding not only the behavior of individuals,
but also the way in which information about the quality of a given content can
be deduced from view counts when only part of the viewers that access the
content are informed about its quality. In this paper we present a game
formulation for the behavior of individuals using a meanfield model: the number
of individuals is approximated by a continuum of atomless players and for which
the Wardrop equilibrium is the solution concept. We derive conditions on the
problem's parameters that result indeed in the emergence of threshold
equilibria policies. But we also identify some parameters in which other
structures are obtained for the equilibrium behavior of individuals.

spatial systems which is obtained from the framework of interacting particle
systems by replacing the traditional graphical structure that defines the
network of interactions with a structure of hypergraph. This new perspective is
more appropriate to define stochastic spatial processes in which large blocks
of vertices may flip simultaneously, which is then applied to define a spatial
version of the Galam's majority rule model. In our spatial model, each vertex
of the lattice has one of two possible competing opinions, say opinion 0 and
opinion 1, as in the popular voter model. Hyperedges are updated at rate one,
which results in all the vertices in the hyperedge changing simultaneously
their opinion to the majority opinion of the hyperedge. In the case of a tie in
hyperedges with even size, a bias is introduced in favor of type 1, which is
motivated by the principle of social inertia. Our analytical results along with
simulations and heuristic arguments suggest that, in any spatial dimensions and
when the set of hyperedges consists of the collection of all n x ... x n blocks
of the lattice, opinion 1 wins when n is even while the system clusters when n
is odd, which contrasts with results about the voter model in high dimensions
for which opinions coexist. This is fully proved in one dimension while the

if and how these scaling laws are inter-related is missing so far, let alone
whether they can be understood through a common, dynamical principle. We
propose a simple model for stationary network formation and show that the three

The validity of the model is tested on multiplex data from a well studied
massive multiplayer online game. We find that the three scaling exponents

models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in
nature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many
real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of
interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing
interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world
situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network
statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are
represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent
vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or
economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we
derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of
networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a
prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced
node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved
representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their
unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network
structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU
countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and
economic robustness.

  Networks","  We used a large database of 9 billion calls from 20 million mobile users to
examine the relationships between aggregated time spent on the phone, personal
network size, tie strength and the way in which users distributed their limited
time across their network (disparity). Compared to those with smaller networks,
those with large networks did not devote proportionally more time to
communication and had on average weaker ties (as measured by time spent
communicating). Further, there were not substantially different levels of
disparity between individuals, in that mobile users tend to distribute their
time very unevenly across their network, with a large proportion of calls going
to a small number of individuals. Together, these results suggest that there
are time constraints which limit tie strength in large personal networks, and
that even high levels of mobile communication do not fundamentally alter the
disparity of time allocation across networks.

but the emerging field of computational social science allows us to overcome
them by analyzing large-scale datasets. In this article, we study cultural
dynamics through the votes in the Eurovision song contest, which are decided by
a crowd-based scheme in which viewers vote through mobile phone messages.
Taking into account asymmetries and imperfect perception of culture, we measure
cultural relations among European countries in terms of cultural affinity. We
propose the Friend-or-Foe coefficient, a metric to measure voting biases among
participants of a Eurovision contest. We validate how this metric represents
cultural affinity through its relation with known cultural distances, and
through numerical analysis of biased Eurovision contests. We apply this metric
to the historical set of Eurovision contests from 1975 to 2012, finding new
patterns of stronger modularity than using votes alone. Furthermore, we define
a measure of polarization that, when applied to empirical data, shows a sharp
increase within EU countries during 2010 and 2011. We empirically validate the
relation between this polarization and economic indicators in the EU, showing
how political decisions influence both the economy and the way citizens relate
to the culture of other EU members.

indicates that link analysis may help to get a first insight into the

Recently, attempts to formalize mathematically these expectations have led to
the hypothesis of urban scaling, namely that certain properties of all cities
change, on average, with their size in predictable scale-invariant ways. The
emergence of these scaling relations depends on a few general properties of
cities as social networks, co-located in space and time, that conceivably apply
to a wide range of human settlements. Here, we discuss the present evidence for
the hypothesis of urban scaling, some of the methodological issues dealing with
proxy measurements and units of analysis and place these findings in the
context of other theories of cities and urban systems. We show that a large
body of evidence about the scaling properties of cities indicates, in analogy
to other complex systems, that they cannot be treated as extensive systems and
discuss the consequences of these results for an emerging statistical theory of
cities.

still limited; the field lacks large-scale datasets describing both individual
behaviors and their collective interactions. However, here, with the help of
travel smart card data, we uncover such encounter mechanisms and structures by
constructing a time-resolved in-vehicle social encounter network on public
buses in a city (about 5 million residents). This is the first time that such a
large network of encounters has been identified and analyzed. Using a
population scale dataset, we find physical encounters display reproducible
temporal patterns, indicating that repeated encounters are regular and
identical. On an individual scale, we find that collective regularities
dominate distinct encounters' bounded nature. An individual's encounter
capability is rooted in his/her daily behavioral regularity, explaining the
emergence of \"familiar strangers\" in daily life. Strikingly, we find
individuals with repeated encounters are not grouped into small communities,
but become strongly connected over time, resulting in a large, but
imperceptible, small-world contact network or \"structure of co-presence\" across
the whole metropolitan area. Revealing the encounter pattern and identifying
this large-scale contact network are crucial to understanding the dynamics in
patterns of social acquaintances, collective human behaviors, and --
particularly -- disclosing the impact of human behavior on various

spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori
knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the
susceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated
connectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to
use local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to
identify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node
degree {\delta}, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of
the estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and
asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node is a suspect, Pc(n)
asymptotically grows from 0.25 to 0.307 with {\delta} from 3 to infinity, a
result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different
approach; and it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}.
Second, when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the network, Pc(n)
asymptotically significantly exceeds the a priori probability if {\delta}>2,
and reliable detection is achieved as {\delta} becomes large; furthermore, it
monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Third, when there
are only two suspects, Pc(n) is asymptotically at least 0.75 if {\delta}>2; and
it increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are
multiple suspects, among all possible connection patterns, that they form a
connected subgraph of the network achieves the smallest detection probability.
Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model in probability theory
and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in
the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.

Data ban studies, geography, transportation and territory management. In
network sciences mobility studies have become popular in the past few years,
especially using mobile phone location data. For preserving the customer
privacy, datasets furnished by telecom operators are anonymized. At the same
time, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all
observed trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be
to sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile
user makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of
users from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,
taking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations
recorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:
having more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the
most frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated
only at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this
fact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their
communication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in
terms of spatial and temporal scale. In this paper we propose to estimate the
correlation between the users communication and mo- bility in order to better
assess the bias of frequency based sampling. Using technical GSM network data
(including communication but also independent mobility records), we will
analyze the relationship between communication and mobility patterns.

anomalous clusters: robot-based callers, telecom frauds, and telephone sales.
This information is of interest to both academics and practitioners, mobile
telecom operator in particular. In contrast, the individual users with a
Weibull duration distribution form the fourth cluster of ordinary cellphone
users. We also discover more information about the calling patterns of these
four clusters, e.g., the probability that a user will call the $c_r$-th most
contact and the probability distribution of burst sizes. Our findings may
enable a more detailed analysis of the huge body of data contained in the logs
of massive users.

traces of information flow can be obtained by looking at temporal sequences of
user interactions. These sequences can be represented as causality trees whose
statistics result from a complex interplay between the topology of the
underlying (social) network and the time correlations among the communications.
Here, we study causality trees in mobile-phone data, which can be represented
as a dynamical directed network. This representation of the data reveals the
existence of super-spreaders and super-receivers. We show that the tree
statistics, respectively the information spreading process, are extremely
sensitive to the in-out degree correlation exhibited by the users. We also
learn that a given information, e.g., a rumor, would require users to
retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic fraction
of the system. Our analysis indicates that topological node-node correlations
of the underlying social network, while allowing the existence of information
loops, they also promote information spreading. Temporal correlations, and
therefore causality effects, are only visible as local phenomena and during
short time scales. These results are obtained through a combination of theory
and data analysis techniques.

important thing is the ability to extract these users as quick as possible,
i.e. developed the algorithm that will be time-effective in large social
networks where number of nodes and edges equal few millions. In this master

to communities within the wider online network of the extreme right, given its

aspects of human interaction. Previous studies have shown that individuals'
communication patterns have complex temporal structure, and that this structure
has system-wide effects. In this paper we use mobile phone records to show that
interaction patterns involving multiple individuals have non-trivial temporal
structure that cannot be deduced from a network presentation where only
interaction frequencies are taken into account. We apply a recently introduced
method, temporal motifs, to identify interaction patterns in a temporal network
where nodes have additional attributes such as gender and age. We then develop
a null model that allows identifying differences between various types of nodes
so that these differences are independent of the network based on interaction
frequencies. We find gender-related differences in communication patters, and
show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals
to participate in interaction patterns beyond what would be expected on the
basis of the network structure alone. We also show that temporal patterns
differ between dense and sparse parts of the network. Because this result is
independent of edge weights, it can be considered as an extension of
Granovetter's hypothesis to temporal networks.

interactions. Guaranteed community detection has so far been mostly limited to
models with non-overlapping communities such as the stochastic block model. In
this paper, we remove this restriction, and provide guaranteed community
detection for a family of probabilistic network models with overlapping
communities, termed as the mixed membership Dirichlet model, first introduced
by Airoldi et al. This model allows for nodes to have fractional memberships in
multiple communities and assumes that the community memberships are drawn from
a Dirichlet distribution. Moreover, it contains the stochastic block model as a
special case. We propose a unified approach to learning these models via a
tensor spectral decomposition method. Our estimator is based on low-order
moment tensor of the observed network, consisting of 3-star counts. Our
learning method is fast and is based on simple linear algebraic operations,
e.g. singular value decomposition and tensor power iterations. We provide
guaranteed recovery of community memberships and model parameters and present a
careful finite sample analysis of our learning method. As an important special
case, our results match the best known scaling requirements for the

  the effects from authors' visibility on their h-index","  Various factors are believed to govern the selection of references in
citation networks, but a precise, quantitative determination of their
importance has remained elusive. In this paper, we show that three factors can
account for the referencing pattern of citation networks for two topics, namely
\"graphenes\" and \"complex networks\", thus allowing one to reproduce the
topological features of the networks built with papers being the nodes and the
edges established by citations. The most relevant factor was content
similarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and {age of
publication} had varying importance depending on the topic studied. This
dependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by
intuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or
institutions to affect the referencing pattern, and this is only indirectly
considered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation.
Because information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its
effect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with
distinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have
twice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for
a paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger
fitness evolved with time with slightly higher values than for the control
network (no fitness considered), a drastic effect was noted for the community
with smaller fitness.

path length (particularly, the asymmetry of the distribution)}. Furthermore,
over time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths,
which is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use
of the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution
of word frequency. Changes in literary style were also found to be driven by
opposition to earlier writing styles, as revealed by the analysis performed
with geometrical concepts. The approaches adopted here are generic and may be
extended to analyze a number of features of languages and cultures.

Disambiguation (WSD) by treating texts as complex networks, and show that word
senses can be distinguished upon characterizing the local structure around

system, but we nevertheless found that in half of the cases our approach
outperforms traditional shallow methods. We show that the hierarchical
connectivity and clustering of words are usually the most relevant features for
WSD. The results reported here shine light on the relationship between semantic
and structural parameters of complex networks. They also indicate that when
combined with traditional techniques the complex network approach may be useful

that the internal structures formed by the words do present patterns that,

  Perspective","  The study of social networks is a burgeoning research area. However, most
existing work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships
exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive
(\"like\", \"trust\") or negative (\"dislike\", \"distrust\"). The theory of social
balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that,
in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both
local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental
problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering.
Motivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of
sign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised
learning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges
based on triangles and \ell-cycles for relatively small values of \ell.
Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the
classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction,
actually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed
networks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks,
we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and
clustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical
performance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem
sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive
experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our
experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of
balance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in
prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore
highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the
analysis of signed networks.

Most community detection algorithms are based on optimizing a combinatorial
parameter, for example modularity. This optimization is generally NP-hard, thus
merely changing the vertex order can alter their assignments to the community.
However, there has been very less study on how vertex ordering influences the
results of the community detection algorithms. Here we identify and study the
properties of invariant groups of vertices (constant communities) whose
assignment to communities are, quite remarkably, not affected by vertex
ordering. The percentage of constant communities can vary across different
applications and based on empirical results we propose metrics to evaluate
these communities. Using constant communities as a pre-processing step, one can
significantly reduce the variation of the results. Finally, we present a case
study on phoneme network and illustrate that constant communities, quite
strikingly, form the core functional units of the larger communities.

Facebook, Orkut, Myspace, to identify causes for the decline of social
networks. We define social resilience as the ability of a community to
withstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but
concentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may
trigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may
lead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if
the size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the
k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at
least k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which
have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this
difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining
network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit
c/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to
calculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to
infer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online
communities. We find that the different online communities have different
k-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a
different impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on
the evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering
the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a
precursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied
to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily
increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or
even to collapse.

meaningfully. We propose a collection of \emph{directed closure values} for
measuring triangles in directed graphs in a way that is analogous to
transitivity in an undirected graph. Our study of these values reveals much
information about directed triadic closure. For instance, we immediately see
that reciprocal edges have a high propensity to participate in triangles. We
also observe striking similarities between the triadic closure patterns of
different web and social networks. We perform mathematical and empirical
analysis showing that directed configuration models that preserve reciprocity

The method exhibits a roughly linear runtime scaling over real-world networks

method employs a branch and bound strategy with novel and aggressive pruning

with a good heuristic clique finder to efficiently remove the vast majority of
the search space. In addition, we parallelize the exploration of the search
tree. During the search, processes immediately communicate changes to upper and
lower bounds on the size of maximum clique, which occasionally results in a
super-linear speedup because vertices with large search spaces can be pruned by
other processes. We apply the algorithm to two problems: to compute temporal
strong components and to compress graphs.

generating a rich trove of data that allows us to study the mechanisms behind
human interactions. Triadic closure has been treated as the major mechanism for
creating social links: if Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie, Alice will
follow Charlie. Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging
data, revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when
expanding their social circles. While the network structure affects the spread
of information among users, the network is in turn shaped by this communication
activity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely
to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users
with a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies,
estimated by a Maximum-Likelihood approach. Triadic closure does have a strong
effect on link formation, but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor
in interpreting network evolution. However, individual strategies for following
other users are highly heterogeneous. Link creation behaviors can be summarized
by classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and
behavioral characteristics. Users who are popular, active, and influential tend
to create traffic-based shortcuts, making the information diffusion process
more efficient in the network.

both reciprocal edges (i.e., edges that have already been linked back) and
parasocial edges (i.e., edges that haven't been linked back). Thus,
understanding the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and parasocial
ones, exploring the factors that influence parasocial edges to become
reciprocal ones, and predicting whether a parasocial edge will turn into a
reciprocal one are basic research problems.
  However, there have been few systematic studies about such problems. In this
paper, we bridge this gap using a novel large-scale Google+ dataset crawled by
ourselves as well as one publicly available social network dataset. First, we
compare the structures and evolutions of reciprocal edges and those of
parasocial edges. For instance, we find that reciprocal edges are more likely
to connect users with similar degrees while parasocial edges are more likely to
link ordinary users (e.g., users with low degrees) and popular users (e.g.,
celebrities). However, the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and
popular users on the network structures increase slowly as the social networks
evolve. Second, we observe that factors including user behaviors, node
attributes, and edge attributes all have significant impacts on the formation
of reciprocal edges. Third, in contrast to previous studies that treat
reciprocal edge prediction as either a supervised or a semi-supervised learning
problem, we identify that reciprocal edge prediction is better modeled as an
outlier detection problem. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations with the
two datasets, and we show that our proposal outperforms previous reciprocal
edge prediction approaches.

  Deletions","  Weibo and other popular Chinese microblogging sites are well known for
exercising internal censorship, to comply with Chinese government requirements.
This research seeks to quantify the mechanisms of this censorship: how fast and
how comprehensively posts are deleted.Our analysis considered 2.38 million
posts gathered over roughly two months in 2012, with our attention focused on
repeatedly visiting \"sensitive\" users. This gives us a view of censorship
events within minutes of their occurrence, albeit at a cost of our data no
longer representing a random sample of the general Weibo population. We also
have a larger 470 million post sampling from Weibo's public timeline, taken
over a longer time period, that is more representative of a random sample.
  We found that deletions happen most heavily in the first hour after a post
has been submitted. Focusing on original posts, not reposts/retweets, we
observed that nearly 30% of the total deletion events occur within 5- 30
minutes. Nearly 90% of the deletions happen within the first 24 hours.
Leveraging our data, we also considered a variety of hypotheses about the
mechanisms used by Weibo for censorship, such as the extent to which Weibo's
censors use retrospective keyword-based censorship, and how repost/retweet
popularity interacts with censorship. We also used natural language processing
techniques to analyze which topics were more likely to be censored.

  approach","  Based on network analysis of hierarchical structural relations among Chinese
characters, we develop an efficient learning strategy of Chinese characters. We
regard a more efficient learning method if one learns the same number of useful
Chinese characters in less effort or time. We construct a node-weighted network
of Chinese characters, where character usage frequencies are used as node
weights. Using this hierarchical node-weighted network, we propose a new
learning method, the distributed node weight (DNW) strategy, which is based on
a new measure of nodes' importance that takes into account both the weight of
the nodes and the hierarchical structure of the network. Chinese character
learning strategies, particularly their learning order, are analyzed as
dynamical processes over the network. We compare the efficiency of three
theoretical learning methods and two commonly used methods from mainstream
Chinese textbooks, one for Chinese elementary school students and the other for
students learning Chinese as a second language. We find that the DNW method
significantly outperforms the others, implying that the efficiency of current
learning methods of major textbooks can be greatly improved.

been widely investigated during last years. Recently, a novel measure of node
centrality has been proposed, called k-path centrality index, which is based on
the propagation of messages inside a network along paths consisting of at most
k edges. On the other hand, the importance of computing the centrality of edges
has been put into evidence since 1970's by Anthonisse and, subsequently by
Girvan and Newman. In this work we propose the generalization of the concept of
k-path centrality by defining the k-path edge centrality, a measure of
centrality introduced to compute the importance of edges. We provide an
efficient algorithm, running in O(k m), being m the number of edges in the
graph. Thus, our technique is feasible for large scale network analysis.
Finally, the performance of our algorithm is analyzed, discussing the results
obtained against large online social network datasets.

and record the traces of online activities. From the analysis of these
large-scale data sets (i.e. traces), we can get insights about dynamic behavior
of human activity. In this letter, the scaling behavior and complexity of human
activity in the e-commerce, such as music, book, and movie rating, are
comprehensively investigated by using detrended fluctuation analysis technique
and multiscale entropy method. Firstly, the interevent time series of rating
behaviors of these three type medias show the similar scaling property with
exponents ranging from 0.53 to 0.58, which implies that the collective
behaviors of rating media follow a process embodying self-similarity and
long-range correlation. Meanwhile, by dividing the users into three groups
based their activities (i.e., rating per unit time), we find that the scaling
exponents of interevent time series in three groups are different. Hence, these
results suggest the stronger long-range correlations exist in these collective
behaviors. Furthermore, their information complexities vary from three groups.
To explain the differences of the collective behaviors restricted to three
groups, we study the dynamic behavior of human activity at individual level,
and find that the dynamic behaviors of a few users have extremely small scaling
exponents associating with long-range anticorrelations. By comparing with the
interevent time distributions of four representative users, we can find that
the bimodal distributions may bring the extraordinary scaling behaviors. These
results of analyzing the online human activity in the e-commerce may not only
provide insights to understand its dynamic behaviors but also be applied to
acquire the potential economic interest.

geographical distance, social relationships, or common interests among people
in a social network, for example. This information can naturally be modeled by
a set of weighted and undirected graphs that form a global multilayer graph,
where the common vertex set represents the entities and the edges on different
layers capture the similarities of the entities in term of the different
modalities. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing multi-layer

combine the characteristics of individual graph layers using tools from

be viewed as a low dimensional representation of the original data which
preserves the most important information from diverse relationships between

superior or competitive performances compared to baseline and state-of-the-art

an analytically tractable adaptive dynamic network model of collective

social systems globally. Here we analyze the principles of security in
different domains and demonstrate an architectural flaw in current
cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the
ability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The
current architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate
transparently with one another, so security would require protecting every
computer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems
depend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police
patrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending
each individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides
security against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,
membranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We
propose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge.
This will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating
securityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b)
Modifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security
software that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune
system architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to
cybersecurity. Among these principles is a careful interplay of detection and
action that includes evolutionary improvement. However, achieving significant
security gains by applying these principles depends strongly on remedying the
underlying architectural limitations.

  Human interactions","  Networks are commonly used to define underlying interaction structures where
infections, information, or other quantities may spread. Although the standard
approach has been to aggregate all links into a static structure, some studies
suggest that the time order in which the links are established may alter the
dynamics of spreading. In this paper, we study the impact of the time ordering
in the limits of flow on various empirical temporal networks. By using a random
walk dynamics, we estimate the flow on links and convert the original
undirected network (temporal and static) into a directed flow network. We then
introduce the concept of flow motifs and quantify the divergence in the
representativity of motifs when using the temporal and static frameworks. We
find that the regularity of contacts and persistence of vertices (common in
email communication and face-to-face interactions) result on little differences
in the limits of flow for both frameworks. On the other hand, in the case of
communication within a dating site (and of a sexual network), the flow between
vertices changes significantly in the temporal framework such that the static
approximation poorly represents the structure of contacts. We have also
observed that cliques with 3 and 4 vertices con- taining only low-flow links
are more represented than the same cliques with all high-flow links. The
representativity of these low-flow cliques is higher in the temporal framework.
Our results suggest that the flow between vertices connected in cliques depend
on the topological context in which they are placed and in the time sequence in
which the links are established. The structure of the clique alone does not
completely characterize the potential of flow between the vertices.

problem with applications in various domains. Most of the existing approaches
have focused on discovering communities of nodes, while recent studies have
shown great advantages and utilities of the knowledge of communities of links
in networks. From this new perspective, we propose a link dynamics based
algorithm, called UELC, for identifying link communities of networks. In UELC,
the stochastic process of a link-node-link random walk is employed to unfold an
embedded bipartition structure of links in a network. The local mixing
properties of the Markov chain underlying the random walk are then utilized to
extract two emerged link communities. Further, the random walk and the
bipartitioning processes are wrapped in an iterative subdivision strategy to
recursively identify link partitions that segregate the network links into
multiple subdivisions. We evaluate the performance of the new method on
synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its utility on real-world networks. Our
experimental results show that our method is highly effective for discovering
link communities in complex networks. As a comparison, we also extend UELC to
extracting communities of node, and show that it is effective for node
community identification.

temporal networks and show that on the Web, networks follow a nonlinear
preferential attachment model in which the exponent depends on the type of
network considered. The classical preferential attachment model for networks by
Barab\'asi and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number
of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment. Although
this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the
underlying linearity is rarely measured. To fill this gap, this paper performs
an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network
datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and
bipartite networks. We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential
attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration. Furthermore, we
observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network,
giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear
attachment in others. Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent
$\beta$ as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate
different types of networks. We propose explanations for the behavior of that

this paper, we empirically analyze the real-world human movements based GPS
records, and observe rich scaling properties in the temporal-spatial patterns
as well as an abnormal transition in the speed-displacement patterns. We notice
that the displacements at the population level show significant positive
correlation, indicating a cascade-like nature in human movements. Furthermore,
our analysis at the individual level finds that the displacement distributions
of users with strong correlation of displacements are closer to power laws,
implying a relationship between the positive correlation of the series of
displacements and the form of an individual's displacement distribution. These
findings from our empirical analysis show a factor directly relevant to the
origin of the scaling properties in human mobility.

systems is commonly focalised on edge processes, and a dual edge-centric
perspective can often prove more natural. Here we present graph-theoretical
measures to quantify edge-to-edge relations inspired by the notion of flow
redistribution induced by edge failures. Our measures, which are related to the
pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian of the network, are global and reveal the
dynamical interplay between the edges of a network, including potentially
non-local interactions. Our framework also allows us to define the embeddedness
of an edge, a measure of how strongly an edge features in the weighted cuts of
the network. We showcase the general applicability of our edge-centric
framework through analyses of the Iberian Power grid, traffic flow in road
networks, and the C. elegans neuronal network.

  networks","  Thanks to widely available, cheap Internet access and the ubiquity of
smartphones, millions of people around the world now use online location-based
social networking services. Understanding the structural properties of these
systems and their dependence upon users' habits and mobility has many potential
applications, including resource recommendation and link prediction. Here, we
construct and characterise social and place-focused graphs by using
longitudinal information about declared social relationships and about users'
visits to physical places collected from a popular online location-based social
service. We show that although the social and place-focused graphs are
constructed from the same data set, they have quite different structural
properties. We find that the social and location-focused graphs have different
global and meso-scale structure, and in particular that social and
place-focused communities have negligible overlap. Consequently, group
inference based on community detection performed on the social graph alone
fails to isolate place-focused groups, even though these do exist in the
network. By studying the evolution of tie structure within communities, we show
that the time period over which location data are aggregated has a substantial
impact on the stability of place-focused communities, and that information
about place-based groups may be more useful for user-centric applications than
that obtained from the analysis of social communities alone.

We propose a \"conversational vibrancy\" framework to capture dynamics of
hashtags based on their topicality, interactivity, diversity, and prominence.
Statistical analyses of the growth and persistence of hashtags reveal novel
relationships between features of this framework and the relative success of
hashtags. Specifically, retweets always contribute to faster hashtag adoption,
replies extend the life of \"winners\" while having no effect on \"also-rans.\"
This is the first study on the lifecycle of hashtag adoption and use in
response to purely exogenous shocks. We draw on theories of uses and

findings and their implications for understanding social influence and
collective action in social media more generally.

relations between them. For instance, in networks of websites, scientific
papers, and other documents, each node has content consisting of a collection
of words, as well as hyperlinks or citations to other nodes. In order to
perform inference on such data sets, and make predictions and recommendations,
it is useful to have models that are able to capture the processes which
generate the text at each node and the links between them. In this paper, we
combine classic ideas in topic modeling with a variant of the mixed-membership
block model recently developed in the statistical physics community. The
resulting model has the advantage that its parameters, including the mixture of
topics of each document and the resulting overlapping communities, can be
inferred with a simple and scalable expectation-maximization algorithm. We test
our model on three data sets, performing unsupervised topic classification and
link prediction. For both tasks, our model outperforms several existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy with significantly less

can further understanding of the mechanics of Internet-based mobilisation. This
trace data offers social science researchers the potential for new forms of
analysis, using real-time transactional data based on entire populations,
rather than sample-based surveys of what people think they did or might do.
This paper uses a `big data' approach to track the growth of over 8,000
petitions to the UK Government on the No. 10 Downing Street website for two
years, analysing the rate of growth per day and testing the hypothesis that the
distribution of daily change will be leptokurtic (rather than normal) as
previous research on agenda setting would suggest. This hypothesis is
confirmed, suggesting that Internet-based mobilisation is characterized by
tipping points (or punctuated equilibria) and explaining some of the volatility
in online collective action. We find also that most successful petitions grow
quickly and that the number of signatures a petition receives on its first day
is a significant factor in explaining the overall number of signatures a
petition receives during its lifetime. These findings have implications for the
strategies of those initiating petitions and the design of web sites with the
aim of maximising citizen engagement with policy issues.

social mining, and the idea of trust networks and privacy-aware social mining.
We discuss the ingredients of a science and a technology necessary to build the
PNS upon the three mentioned pillars, beyond the limitations of their
respective state-of-art. Social sensing is aimed at developing better methods
for harvesting the big data from the techno-social ecosystem and make them
available for mining, learning and analysis at a properly high abstraction
level.Social mining is the problem of discovering patterns and models of human
behaviour from the sensed data across the various social dimensions by data
mining, machine learning and social network analysis. Trusted networks and
privacy-aware social mining is aimed at creating a new deal around the
questions of privacy and data ownership empowering individual persons with full
awareness and control on own personal data, so that users may allow access and
use of their data for their own good and the common good. The PNS will provide
a goal-oriented knowledge discovery framework, made of technology and people,
able to configure itself to the aim of answering questions about the pulse of
global society. Given an analytical request, the PNS activates a process
composed by a variety of interconnected tasks exploiting the social sensing and
mining methods within the transparent ecosystem provided by the trusted
network.

  competitions","  In most professional sports, the structure of the environment is kept neutral
so that scoring imbalances may be attributed to differences in team skill. It
thus remains unknown what impact structural heterogeneities can have on scoring
dynamics and producing competitive advantages. Applying a generative model of
scoring dynamics to roughly 10 million team competitions drawn from an online
game, we quantify the relationship between a competition's structure and its
scoring dynamics. Despite wide structural variations, we find the same
three-phase pattern in the tempo of events observed in many sports. Tempo and
balance are highly predictable from a competition's structural features alone
and teams exploit environmental heterogeneities for sustained competitive
advantage. The most balanced competitions are associated with specific
environmental heterogeneities, not from equally skilled teams. These results
shed new light on the principles of balanced competition, and illustrate the
potential of online game data for investigating social dynamics and
competition.
